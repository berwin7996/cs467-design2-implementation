2016-02-23T04:39:40+0000,"Written by a Facebook member...a good read..........I've been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, people say that he doesn't have a platform, that he just wants to make America great again. I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he's standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats. That is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set. This man is prepared in business and it will be prepared when the time is right in a debate. He is a brilliant man, and he will not reveal his hand. He doesn't have to, he has his supporters. They believe in him, they know he could be the commander in chief and lead this country in the right direction. As far as foreign policy, you say he lacks. What I say is he knows the economy, he knows the about taxes, trade, laws, foreign values, he knows that inside and out because he's dealt with them for so many years. Now if he hadn't been good with dealing with the foreign market, he wouldn't be the billionaire that he is now. He is a international brand. He knows leaders and foreign dignitaries. He is an economic genius with the skills to make this country great again. By bringing businesses back into this country and creating jobs. This will only help our economy. He would protect the United States from those who want to do us harm. He loves this country, and will do what he has to do to protect it. HE IS bold and brash, he says what he means and means what he says, and that is what we like about him so much. He will be a tough negotiator and our allies will know where he stands at all times. They know his word will mean something, and so will our enemies. This is a brilliant man who has focus and he is pragmatic. He knows how to solve problems quickly. He will surround himself with the best of the best in all branches of the government. You will not see our soldiers kneeling at the feet of Iranian, nor will you see Isis take over the world. You haven't seen the guy work yet. All you've seen is a businessman turned politician before your eyes. His supporters are standing shoulder to shoulder with him and will not sway. Lobbyist and special interest groups will no longer be able to line that pockets of our Congress and Senate. Because when they do, the Senators and congressmen will pass a bills and legislation and it will be a conflict of interest to the United States. No more will you have super PACs running this country. The media can ridicule Donald Trump and his supporters all they want, But we are digging in our heels. We will not be deterred. The fact of the matter is, you think Americans are stupid. But we are the backbone of this country. Americans will determine the vote, not the special special intetest groups or the lobbiests. They will finally understand clearly. Our voices will be heard. We will support our troops and build up our military and take care of our vets. Because this administration has not had their backs, nor have they listened to our top military leaders. No longer will our military hands be tied. He will secure our borders and revamp our visa program. He will do everything in his power to keep American safe. He will call our enemies by name, radicals jihadist. There will no longer be political correctness, for it is destroying our country and dividing us. Americans are finally pulling together as one, United we stand, shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump #DONALDJTRUMP",498652540307651_498730866966485

2016-02-23T03:04:57+0000,"Jeremiah Johnson, pastor of Behold the Man Ministries, has announced that, while he doesn’t particularly support Trump, God is using him for a very special purpose, the Christian Post reports. “The Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, ‘Trump shall become My trumpet to the American people, for he possesses qualities that are even hard to find in My people these days. Trump does not fear man nor will he allow deception and lies to go unnoticed. I am going to use him to expose darkness and perversion in America like never before. But you must understand that he is like a bull in a china closet,'” Johnson said God told him.Johnson assures that he has no political intentions, and that the strange message was given to him apart from his personal convictions. “Many will want to throw him away because he will disturb their sense of peace and tranquility, but you must listen through the bantering to discover the truth that I will speak through him. I will use the wealth that I have given him to expose and launch investigations searching for the truth. Just as I raised up Cyrus to fulfill My purposes and plans, so have I raised up Trump to fulfill my purposes and plans prior to the 2016 election,” he continued, recounting what he claims God revealed during prayer.“You must listen to the trumpet very closely for he will sound the alarm and many will be blessed because of his compassion and mercy. Though many see the outward pride and arrogance, I have given him the tender heart of a father that wants to lend a helping hand to the poor and the needy, to the foreigner and the stranger,” Johnson’s statement ended",498654170307488_498714370301468

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",498629020310003_498683416971230

Both true.  However, what Trump is really doing is simultaneously exposing the entire sordid, corrupt, self-serving, financial manipulative scheme -within a national political construct- that has remained hidden just beneath the surface…..…a horribly corrupt beast, fed by an oblivious electorate. A behemoth, made of media and various news outlets, who serves the financial needs of left and right-wing talking heads, and exists exclusively to keep them in power.
For years we have called those who control this monster: “The Decepticons”. Professional deceivers who exist exclusively for their own scheme and graft.

2016-02-23T03:47:39+0000,"Written by a Facebook member...a good read..........I've been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, people say that he doesn't have a platform, that he just wants to make America great again. I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he's standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats. That is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set. This man is prepared in business and it will be prepared when the time is right in a debate. He is a brilliant man, and he will not reveal his hand. He doesn't have to, he has his supporters. They believe in him, they know he could be the commander in chief and lead this country in the right direction. As far as foreign policy, you say he lacks. What I say is he knows the economy, he knows the about taxes, trade, laws, foreign values, he knows that inside and out because he's dealt with them for so many years. Now if he hadn't been good with dealing with the foreign market, he wouldn't be the billionaire that he is now. He is a international brand. He knows leaders and foreign dignitaries. He is an economic genius with the skills to make this country great again. By bringing businesses back into this country and creating jobs. This will only help our economy. He would protect the United States from those who want to do us harm. He loves this country, and will do what he has to do to protect it. HE IS bold and brash, he says what he means and means what he says, and that is what we like about him so much. He will be a tough negotiator and our allies will know where he stands at all times. They know his word will mean something, and so will our enemies. This is a brilliant man who has focus and he is pragmatic. He knows how to solve problems quickly. He will surround himself with the best of the best in all branches of the government. You will not see our soldiers kneeling at the feet of Iranian, nor will you see Isis take over the world. You haven't seen the guy work yet. All you've seen is a businessman turned politician before your eyes. His supporters are standing shoulder to shoulder with him and will not sway. Lobbyist and special interest groups will no longer be able to line that pockets of our Congress and Senate. Because when they do, the Senators and congressmen will pass a bills and legislation and it will be a conflict of interest to the United States. No more will you have super PACs running this country. The media can ridicule Donald Trump and his supporters all they want, But we are digging in our heels. We will not be deterred. The fact of the matter is, you think Americans are stupid. But we are the backbone of this country. Americans will determine the vote, not the special special intetest groups or the lobbiests. They will finally understand clearly. Our voices will be heard. We will support our troops and build up our military and take care of our vets. Because this administration has not had their backs, nor have they listened to our top military leaders. No longer will our military hands be tied. He will secure our borders and revamp our visa program. He will do everything in his power to keep American safe. He will call our enemies by name, radicals jihadist. There will no longer be political correctness, for it is destroying our country and dividing us. Americans are finally pulling together as one, United we stand, shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump #DONALDJTRUMP",498577933648445_498722530300652

2016-02-22T18:37:59+0000,"Written by a Facebook member...a good read..........I've been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, people say that he doesn't have a platform, that he just wants to make America great again. I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he's standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats. That is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set. This man is prepared in business and it will be prepared when the time is right in a debate. He is a brilliant man, and he will not reveal his hand. He doesn't have to, he has his supporters. They believe in him, they know he could be the commander in chief and lead this country in the right direction. As far as foreign policy, you say he lacks. What I say is he knows the economy, he knows the about taxes, trade, laws, foreign values, he knows that inside and out because he's dealt with them for so many years. Now if he hadn't been good with dealing with the foreign market, he wouldn't be the billionaire that he is now. He is a international brand. He knows leaders and foreign dignitaries. He is an economic genius with the skills to make this country great again. By bringing businesses back into this country and creating jobs. This will only help our economy. He would protect the United States from those who want to do us harm. He loves this country, and will do what he has to do to protect it. HE IS bold and brash, he says what he means and means what he says, and that is what we like about him so much. He will be a tough negotiator and our allies will know where he stands at all times. They know his word will mean something, and so will our enemies. This is a brilliant man who has focus and he is pragmatic. He knows how to solve problems quickly. He will surround himself with the best of the best in all branches of the government. You will not see our soldiers kneeling at the feet of Iranian, nor will you see Isis take over the world. You haven't seen the guy work yet. All you've seen is a businessman turned politician before your eyes. His supporters are standing shoulder to shoulder with him and will not sway. Lobbyist and special interest groups will no longer be able to line that pockets of our Congress and Senate. Because when they do, the Senators and congressmen will pass a bills and legislation and it will be a conflict of interest to the United States. No more will you have super PACs running this country. The media can ridicule Donald Trump and his supporters all they want, But we are digging in our heels. We will not be deterred. The fact of the matter is, you think Americans are stupid. But we are the backbone of this country. Americans will determine the vote, not the special special intetest groups or the lobbiests. They will finally understand clearly. Our voices will be heard. We will support our troops and build up our military and take care of our vets. Because this administration has not had their backs, nor have they listened to our top military leaders. No longer will our military hands be tied. He will secure our borders and revamp our visa program. He will do everything in his power to keep American safe. He will call our enemies by name, radicals jihadist. There will no longer be political correctness, for it is destroying our country and dividing us. Americans are finally pulling together as one, United we stand, shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump #DONALDJTRUMP",498566773649561_498594346980137

Seeing interviews with college students who do not have a clue about how this country is supposed to be governed! SMART UP with who you vote for... as this will greatly affect your future. If you keep up with Bernie Sanders or Pathological Liar Hillary Clinton, a college degree will not be worth the paper it is printed on‼️
We must defeat the democrats and re-gain the WH or this country will plunge into communism.

🚫NO VOTE for RUBIO and CRUZ, they are another establishment puppets!➖bought and owned by establishment.

✔️VOTE TRUMP🇺🇸🇺🇸
✔️LOVE AMERICA🇺🇸🇺🇸",498563696983202_498600270312878

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the official ""Donald Pump"" t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/donaldpump .

2016-02-20T04:17:02+0000,"Dear Mr. Trump,

I believe destiny is the name of a ship that we all sail upon. She transports each of us to our own port of call. While we cannot control the breeze that guides us to our destiny, we, the hardworking Americans of the United States, try to steer Destiny’s rudder in the direction of prosperity.

The destiny of this great nation has been cast adrift; she floats aimlessly without captain, foundering on a sea of entitlement. For far too long her destiny has been neglected. Her hull so laden with barnacles; She is taking on water, she is listing to the left, she is sinking.

The destiny of this country I no longer know? What I do know is this republic of ours does not require a good captain, this nation under God requires a great captain. Mr. Trump, great men are not born, great men are made and they arise out of necessity and circumstance.

I know that you, Mr. Trump, can be a great captain for The United States. We the people have the necessity and one who speaks with the voice of millions creates a circumstance and a destiny for both themselves and their country.

Your destiny, Mr. Trump, is irrevocably entwined in the rigging of this illustrious ship, for it is “The Will Of The People”. It will be an honor to weigh anchor with you and serve as a member of your crew as we sail this great country, The United States of America, into the winds of prosperity, past her blue skies toward a new horizon, where we will moor together at the place called the American dream.

2016-02-20T03:22:47+0000,"WHY VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP
1. Donald Trump is the only candidate who can turn things around for America and should be taken seriously!!!
2. He is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
3. He is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. He is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. He is decisive. As President every decision he makes would be in the best interest of the country. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. He is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. He listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the others -
He attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10 billion dollars.
9. Having an IQ of 157, his knowledge of contracts and negotiating is brilliant/ internationally/ unparalleled. No one builds an international business empire the size of Trump's without being able to win at the negotiating table.
10. He was popular in the Apprentice/ number 1# rated program 10 years running.
11. He wrote 10 best-selling books [ His book the Art of a deal [educational]
12. He owns and operates Miss Universe/ Miss America] beauty pageants.
13. He’s doing business worldwide therefore his experience is desirable/ knows cultures/international taxes/ pricing/ shipping/ unions/ regulations/ contracts/ business/ practices/ suppliers/ safety rules/ types of workers.
14. He’s into construction, media, manufacturing, travel and publishing.
15. He’s a job producer/ just for the records/ most of his CEO’s are women/ yes they make more than the men/ creditability counts.
16. He gives millions to charities.
17. He understands currencies/ money exchanges/ inflation, deflation worldwide wages.
18. His tax program 0-10-15-25 is simple.
19. His universal interstate medical/ insurance program is very realistic/ competition.
20. He has a good five point immigration program.
21. He’s pro military & Vet’s [improve VA hospital/care] Take ISIS oil fields to pay Vets.
22. He wants to seal off the boarder [build that wall] He’s built a 96 story building/ he thinks that’s harder than constructing a wall. He understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
23. He’s anti-Iran deal/ pro-Israel. He says it states we have to protect Iran if Israel attacks [Iran keeps saying they are going to wipe Israel and us off of the map].
24. His pro Christmas stance is anti [political correct].
25. He also realizes that our nation is being trashed worldwide and speaks up about it.
26. He recognizes the China money manipulation policy which is anti-USA.
27. He says that Japan’s tariff on US goods [one way deal making].
28. He wants to put a tariff on Mexican goods/ all traffic/ cut off aid.
29. Remember when Trump said; we protect Saudi Arabia therefore they must pay.
30. We fought and spend billions in Afghanistan to help those people and China is mining their minerals because the Obama administration is incompetent/ can’t win at negotiating/ stupid leaders.
31. He’s warning America of [Poisons vaccines] and the dangers.
32. He wants a high tech military/ a world class military/ hardware/ hacking/ security [too good to fail].
33. He realizes we have a Muslin problem in this nation.
34. He thinks Obama’s birth certificate is a fraud [check out his SS#, no draft card/ old pass port/ E-verification status, school records [remember his dad isn’t American therefore he isn’t qualified for the office he’s in].
35. He will work for a $1 per year salary, give the rest to charity and not accept the pension after presidency if elected.
SUMMARY
Like him or not, agree with him or not, it doesn’t matter. So far Trump is the only candidate who has shown that he “can up-set the apple-cart” and make things happen and he is exactly what America needs at this point in time! Everybody should do their homework on the candidates. We must not listen to the “political media”. They are not going to tell you the truth! They have a way of twisting words for their own story and agenda! There is an important choice that each voter has to make. Either you cast your vote for another “puppet candidate” and support business as usual in Washington again or support Donald Trump and HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!",497583957081176_497643753741863

The whole idea of political correctness is an assault on the freedom of the human mind.
Nobody wants to be scorned and mocked, and therefore many of us, consciously or unconsciously, avoid intimidating situations by refraining from standing up for what we really believe.
At its core, then, political correctness is nothing more nor less than the unjust intimidation of others into thinking and speaking a certain way. As such, it is pure totalitarian mind control.
As though we need progressives, the cultural enforcers, to help us understand that we shouldn’t call someone retarded, or use the “N” word, make hurtful comments about someone’s appearance, or tolerate bullies.
If political correctness  truly was about kindness and respect, it wouldn’t need to be imposed on us. After all, we already have a mechanism for the social cohesion “political correctness” is said to represent: it’s called manners. And we already have specific individuals charged with insuring that good manners are instilled and upheld: they’re called parents.

Also, I put some of the blame of the Middle East directly at Bush's feet, if he had focused on Bin Laden, instead of going into Iraq, because if you remember during his 2002 speech he was mad as heck and made that one sentence, that guy tried to kill my Dad, he was talking about Sadam Hussein and refereeing of course to the alleged plot by Iraqi intelligence to assassinate Bush's father George H.W.

2016-02-19T20:38:38+0000,"A major engine for the left’s insatiable quest for power goes under the strange name of “political correctness” – an insidious frontal attack on common sense and conscience through language manipulation.
The whole idea of political correctness is an assault on the freedom of the human mind.
Nobody wants to be scorned and mocked, and therefore many of us, consciously or unconsciously, avoid intimidating situations by refraining from standing up for what we really believe.
At its core, then, political correctness is nothing more nor less than the unjust intimidation of others into thinking and speaking a certain way. As such, it is pure totalitarian mind control.
As though we need progressives, the cultural enforcers, to help us understand that we shouldn’t call someone retarded, or use the “N” word, make hurtful comments about someone’s appearance, or tolerate bullies.
If political correctness  truly was about kindness and respect, it wouldn’t need to be imposed on us. After all, we already have a mechanism for the social cohesion “political correctness” is said to represent: it’s called manners. And we already have specific individuals charged with insuring that good manners are instilled and upheld: they’re called parents.

He has shown himself to be a LIAR and a FRAUD by his own admission.

Ted Cruz is not an Article II ""natural born Citizen"" of the US by his own words

Recently, this came to light in: 

THE END OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY By J.B. Williams March 29, 2015 

""In a campaign interview during his freshman senate race, a GOP Texas State Committee member sat down with the young candidate to ask a few poignant vetting questions, and here are the questions and answers from that interview… (Redacted information is to protect the witness at this moment, but the witness is willing to offer sworn testimony)
Interviewer: “Hello Mr. Cruz, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is (redacted). I am a (redacted) County GOP Precinct Chair and you have my support and vote. I have one question for you if I may?”
Cruz: “Sure, go ahead.”

Interviewer: “What is your understanding of how one becomes a natural born Citizen?”

Cruz: “TWO CITIZEN PARENTS AND BORN ON THE SOIL""

Apart from that article, we know that Rafael Edward Cruz, Jr. was born as a Canadian Born citizen (as his own birth certificate says) 
http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/08/19/ted-cruz-releases-birth-certificate-and-is-apparently-a-canadian-citizen-but/
and that Rafael Cruz Sr., is on record saying that at some time in the past
he naturalized himself as a Canadian Citizen
http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/06/20/193585553/how-ted-cruzs-father-shaped-his-views-on-immigration

http://puzo1.blogspot.com/

http://puzo1.blogspot.com.au/2015/11/a-citizen-is-one-thing-but-natural-born.html

IT IS ""settled law""............... The US Supreme Court held that a natural born citizen of the US is one born in the US to BOTH parents being US citizens................... this has never been overruled, over-turned or changed, and remains ""settled law"" at present.

Note that at the time of this holding, the 14th Amendment WAS A PART OF the US Constitution, when the court held ""The Constitution does not in words say who shall be natural-born citizens"".............
i..e. the SCOTUS held that the 14th Amendment DOES NOT SAY who shall be ""natural born citizens"" ....... this has never been changed or overruled.

The US Supreme Court, at the time, also acknowledged doubts whether native-birth in the US to non-citizen parents, made even an ordinary born US citizen, then later in the Wong Kim Ark case settled those doubts by ruling under the 14th Amendment, that a US born child to non-citizens parents who had allegiance to the US, to be a ""citizen of the united states"" by birth, but NOT a ""natural born Citizen"". 

(these non-citizen parents allegiance to the US was not the same or as strong as that of US citizen parents allegiance as citizens, and rightly so)

The US Supreme court effectively made the distinction between two types of born citizens of the US.

All ""natural born Citizens"" are ""citizens of the united states"" by birth, i..e. born as citizens................. but not all who are born as citizens of the US, are ""natural born Citizens"".

The SCOTUS - Minor v Happersett:

""The Constitution does not in words say who shall be natural-born citizens. 
Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that. 
At common law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. 
These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. 
Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. 
As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first.""

2016-02-19T20:27:11+0000,"A major engine for the left’s insatiable quest for power goes under the strange name of “political correctness” – an insidious frontal attack on common sense and conscience through language manipulation.
The whole idea of political correctness is an assault on the freedom of the human mind.
Nobody wants to be scorned and mocked, and therefore many of us, consciously or unconsciously, avoid intimidating situations by refraining from standing up for what we really believe.
At its core, then, political correctness is nothing more nor less than the unjust intimidation of others into thinking and speaking a certain way. As such, it is pure totalitarian mind control.
As though we need progressives, the cultural enforcers, to help us understand that we shouldn’t call someone retarded, or use the “N” word, make hurtful comments about someone’s appearance, or tolerate bullies.
If political correctness  truly was about kindness and respect, it wouldn’t need to be imposed on us. After all, we already have a mechanism for the social cohesion “political correctness” is said to represent: it’s called manners. And we already have specific individuals charged with insuring that good manners are instilled and upheld: they’re called parents.

""Political Correctness"" Is About Control, Not Etiquette

America needs Donald Trump to place political correctness in its place, and let Americans control their own minds and actions with common sense.  Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States of America.",497498270423078_497553847084187

They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting.

2016-02-19T20:47:08+0000,"A major engine for the left’s insatiable quest for power goes under the strange name of “political correctness” – an insidious frontal attack on common sense and conscience through language manipulation.
The whole idea of political correctness is an assault on the freedom of the human mind.
Nobody wants to be scorned and mocked, and therefore many of us, consciously or unconsciously, avoid intimidating situations by refraining from standing up for what we really believe.
At its core, then, political correctness is nothing more nor less than the unjust intimidation of others into thinking and speaking a certain way. As such, it is pure totalitarian mind control.
As though we need progressives, the cultural enforcers, to help us understand that we shouldn’t call someone retarded, or use the “N” word, make hurtful comments about someone’s appearance, or tolerate bullies.
If political correctness  truly was about kindness and respect, it wouldn’t need to be imposed on us. After all, we already have a mechanism for the social cohesion “political correctness” is said to represent: it’s called manners. And we already have specific individuals charged with insuring that good manners are instilled and upheld: they’re called parents.

""Political Correctness"" Is About Control, Not Etiquette

America needs Donald Trump to place political correctness in its place, and let Americans control their own minds and actions with common sense.  Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States of America.",497290943777144_497557287083843

Donald Trump has exposed the order of how the government really works. He has opened the secret door and now the establishment is going crazy trying to discredit  Mr. Trump. He continues to explained to the people who does what in politics and why.  Americans have learned what Super PACs do, how candidates are subject to their donors, how back room deals are done and why seemingly incompetent decisions are made. It is no wonder the Pope was called in to attack Mr. Trump. The new world order is desperate, and Donald Trump is the only person to take them on and beat them.",497257163780522_497336937105878

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the official ""Donald Pump"" t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/donaldpump .

He must be or he would not have stepped up and stepped out to help this woman's family and their family farm.  Trump has made it clear, our country is in the same predicament as the farmer and his land.  We Americans are under water and over our heads and strapped with a 19 trillion dollar  national debt.  The ground beneath our feet is being ripped & stripped  from the American land owner, Farmers or Ranchers.  Sold to the highest globalist elite, or capitalist bidder for the rich and profitable natural resources & water rights  There is a lot of work to be done  to rebuild our infrastructure, create jobs,  and secure our borders.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting.

My coworkers and I discussed it was an mandatory if they died at home or outside a medical facility they would have done an autopsy.

We all know Ted Cruz has lied, he has tried to undermine both Trump, Rubio and Carson with those what should be considered some of the most ruthless scams that politics has ever seen. Ok that said, we see Donald Trump in LEGIT Nationwide and local polls all matching up to basically the same numbers. And not just for Donald all of the other candidates with similar tracking numbers, then out of the blue NBC/WSJ Poll has Cruz over Trump by a few points. If anyone does not see this and NO ONE NO ONE and my former colleagues can't mention this on TV or Radio for FEAR they will lose sponsors. Here is the deal you have these Big Pocket boys and PACS supporting Cruz, and some of them represent or are on the board of MAJOR ADVERTISERS. How do newspapers and Radio and TV networks survive?? ADVERTISING!!! If you don't think this is some backroom deal going on then you are very naive. They simply go to the WSJ or NBC and place big ad buys. And we are not talking political ad buys, it could be auto manufacturers, retailers, whoever and VOILA out of NOWHERE overnight you have a poll that is not in sync with any other poll in the Country!! Doesn't that tell you something? What does Cruz do immediately goes out on the trail and says LOOK AT THE POLLS I AM BEATING DONALD TRUMP!!! I must of received a dozen emails this morning with the subject line, FINALLY CRUZ IS BEATING TRUMP!! If anyone does not believe what is happening this is all part of the last ditch effort I believe by the party, the PACS, the big money donors to TRY to derail the Trump Train.

He is standing against the establishment that controls the six corporations that own the T.V. and radio media, all of the major newspapers, most of the small so-called independent papers, and the 99 percent of the publishing houses. These are the people that also own and control the Federal Reserve and all the Western Central Banks that have held our economy hostage to their New World Order Agenda, robbed us of Constitutional Governance, and relegated our children and Grand Children to debt slavery in a quasi-Marxist Poverty State. This ELECTION is between Donald Trump and the Globalist Criminals that control every aspect of our Government, every NGO that is pushing a Globalist agenda - from the Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros, UNESCO, USAID, and the Clinton Foundation.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the official ""Donald Pump"" t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/donaldpump .

DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT AWAY TO STOP THE CORRUPTION IN THE CAPITAL OR AT LEAST HAVE SPOKEN UP TO WARN US BEFORE NOW ABOUT WHAT THEY KNEW WAS HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND IN BACK ROOMS.

BUT NOW THAT IT'S ELECTION TIME AND THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND IS UP FOR GRABS THEY SPEW THEIR OUTRAGE AT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY AND BLAME THE OTHER PARTY OR BLAME THE PERSON IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

WELL BOYS AND GIRLS THERE IS PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND BECAUSE IF YOU WERE ELECTED TO REPRESENT OTHERS IN WASHINGTON DC AND ALLOWED THE CORRUPTION TO GO UNCHECKED OR DIDN'T BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

MYSELF I WILL NOT VOTE FOR A CAREER POLITICIAN THAT TELLS ME THEY KNOW BEST HOW TO GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK WHEN IN MY OPINION THEY HAVE ALREADY FAILED BY BEING A PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT PUT US IN THE POSITION WE ARE IN.

THE MAN WHO HAS THE PLAN TO REVIVE THIS COUNTRY IS A BUILDER AND A VISIONARY. DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONE TO HELP US TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND CREATE THE JOBS WE NEED TO HAVE A VIBRANT ECONOMY AND TO BUILD OUR MILITARY TO REGAIN OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD AS A LEADER NATION.

2016-02-17T23:05:24+0000,"What exactly does America get in a Donald Trump presidency? Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it. It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great. He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump. No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with half a brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally. Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people. He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",496881603818078_496930697146502

2016-02-17T19:54:13+0000,"Political correctness is running rampant, and it is absolutely destroying this nation.
If you say the “wrong thing” in America today, you could be penalized, fired or even taken to court.
Every single day, the mainstream media in the United States bombards us with subtle messages about what we should believe and what “appropriate speech” consists of.

Most of the time, most Americans quietly fall in line with this unwritten speech code.In fact, most of the time we enforce this unwritten speech code among each other. Those that would dare to buck the system are finding out that the consequences can be rather severe.
American’s are succumbing to reduced language created by the totalitarian state as a tool to limit free thought, and concepts that pose a threat to the regime such as freedom, self-expression, individuality, peace, etc. Soon any form of thought alternative to the party’s construct will be classified as ‘thought crime.’”
Donald Trump does NOT play this game. Donald Trump knows the perpetrators and is out to take America Back and the perps hate him more than ever for foiling the plot. It is time we American’s stop letting the media choose our President and way of life.

2016-02-17T17:39:51+0000,"Political correctness is running rampant, and it is absolutely destroying this nation.
If you say the “wrong thing” in America today, you could be penalized, fired or even taken to court.
Every single day, the mainstream media in the United States bombards us with subtle messages about what we should believe and what “appropriate speech” consists of.

Most of the time, most Americans quietly fall in line with this unwritten speech code.In fact, most of the time we enforce this unwritten speech code among each other. Those that would dare to buck the system are finding out that the consequences can be rather severe.
American’s are succumbing to reduced language created by the totalitarian state as a tool to limit free thought, and concepts that pose a threat to the regime such as freedom, self-expression, individuality, peace, etc. Soon any form of thought alternative to the party’s construct will be classified as ‘thought crime.’”
Donald Trump does NOT play this game. Donald Trump knows the perpetrators and is out to take America Back and the perps hate him more than ever for foiling the plot. It is time we American’s stop letting the media choose our President and way of life.

Subj: interesting take on Trump

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",496840407155531_496879227151649

If you say the “wrong thing” in America today, you could be penalized, fired or even taken to court.
Every single day, the mainstream media in the United States bombards us with subtle messages about what we should believe and what “appropriate speech” consists of.

Most of the time, most Americans quietly fall in line with this unwritten speech code.In fact, most of the time we enforce this unwritten speech code among each other. Those that would dare to buck the system are finding out that the consequences can be rather severe.
American’s are succumbing to reduced language created by the totalitarian state as a tool to limit free thought, and concepts that pose a threat to the regime such as freedom, self-expression, individuality, peace, etc. Soon any form of thought alternative to the party’s construct will be classified as ‘thought crime.’”
Donald Trump does NOT play this game. Donald Trump knows the perpetrators and is out to take America Back and the perps hate him more than ever for foiling the plot. It is time we American’s stop letting the media choose our President and way of life.

I have seen what is going on in this country we have always been a land of immigrants , but now were dealing with Illegal immigrants and legal ones that have taken or kindness a sign of weakness and are trying to transform our country into their idea of a United States.
Trump know this as most of us do and few will admit it painful as it is we can't  afford to be so kind anymore we can't.
Our very sovereignty is in danger of being distorted by our own kindness and the democrats that are using Illegal immigrants to do it along with a twisting of our constitution in ways I can't began to tell you.
Trump is 100% right we can not Afford to be so nice anymore.

Trump can work with the foreign powers from a point of strength and pride not weakness and stupidity, they may not like dealing with Trump but they will respect him even if they don't see eye to eye but they will for dam sure know we mean business and were not playing around.

The Latinos, blacks and middle eastern prople,  should get on board with Trump and be part of the fixing the problem not keep being the problem because if he is president and I'm petty sure he will be, so all of you are going to take a large dose of the constitution rather you like it or not choose your side wisely my future Americans .

Trump has a special place in his heart for immigrants and loves people that come here and want to be legal Americans his wife was an immigrant and she took the steps to be an Americans  the right way that's all Trump wants and most Americans we want you all here Mexican, Asian , Russian it don't matter we would treat you like one of us always just do it legal that's all we ask of you. us any more we will crush your story's by laughing in your face .",496561463850092_496662290506676

A man in Iowa wrote this just to let people know how Cruz cheated and what he did to Carson a friend was speaking at a caucus for Carson last night. ..and this is what he went through which Candy Carson also walked in on...I told him I wanted to share his story...so here it is~

""here is what I witnessed last night. I was a guest speaker on behalf of Ben Carson at the Caucus in Altoona at an elementary school and I spoke last night. My pro Carson speech speech included an introduction that I was from one state over in Wisconsin and that my family were Polish immigrants. After my speech was over the Ted Cruz spokeperson made their speech and closed with ""By the way Ben Carson is dropping out of the race"". I got up and shouted ""he's lying"". Immediatelty after that...who walks in? CANDY CARSON! Ben Carson's wife! She backed me up and said it was a lie that Ben was dropping out and not to be deterred. The people then voted and Ben came in 2ND PLACE! Just 8 votes shy of first place. While I was observing the vote count, the Cruz staffers told me ""back up away from the table....you are in OUR state now....go back to Wisconsin you Dumb Polak!""....These are the kind of people that Cruz hires. Remember a couple days before this Cruz sent out mailers to people sharing their neighbor's voting records to shame & embarrass them and pressure them. Ted Cruz is a PHONY ladies and gentlemen. He campaigns as a ""Conservative Christian"" and spreads outright lies in order to to steal a win illegitimately inn an election. He campaigns as a ""fierce protector of privacy rights"" and then sends out mailers withn people's personal voting information to their neighbors, putting them in possible danger. Folks this guy is either a piece of garbage or a complete ignoramus. Take your pick. Either way he is NOT qualified to be the Republican nominee or President of the United States. I hope the American people will realize this man doesn;t have what it takes to face Hillary Clinton in the general election. How is he supposed to attack Hillary for being a liar, dishonest and untrustworthy when he HIMSELF is a liar?! -- Sheryl Leonard, Michiganders for Dr. Ben Carson.

2016-02-16T17:27:00+0000,"WHY VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP
1. Donald Trump is the only candidate who can turn things around for America and should be taken seriously!!!
2. He is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
3. He is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. He is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. He is decisive. As President every decision he makes would be in the best interest of the country. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. He is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. He listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the others -
He attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10 billion dollars.
9. Having an IQ of 157, his knowledge of contracts and negotiating is brilliant/ internationally/ unparalleled. No one builds an international business empire the size of Trump's without being able to win at the negotiating table.
10. He was popular in the Apprentice/ number 1# rated program 10 years running.
11. He wrote 10 best-selling books [ His book the Art of a deal [educational]
12. He owns and operates Miss Universe/ Miss America] beauty pageants.
13. He’s doing business worldwide therefore his experience is desirable/ knows cultures/international taxes/ pricing/ shipping/ unions/ regulations/ contracts/ business/ practices/ suppliers/ safety rules/ types of workers.
14. He’s into construction, media, manufacturing, travel and publishing.
15. He’s a job producer/ just for the records/ most of his CEO’s are women/ yes they make more than the men/ creditability counts.
16. He gives millions to charities.
17. He understands currencies/ money exchanges/ inflation, deflation worldwide wages.
18. His tax program 0-10-15-25 is simple.
19. His universal interstate medical/ insurance program is very realistic/ competition.
20. He has a good five point immigration program.
21. He’s pro military & Vet’s [improve VA hospital/care] Take ISIS oil fields to pay Vets.
22. He wants to seal off the boarder [build that wall] He’s built a 96 story building/ he thinks that’s harder than constructing a wall. He understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
23. He’s anti-Iran deal/ pro-Israel. He says it states we have to protect Iran if Israel attacks [Iran keeps saying they are going to wipe Israel and us off of the map].
24. His pro Christmas stance is anti [political correct].
25. He also realizes that our nation is being trashed worldwide and speaks up about it.
26. He recognizes the China money manipulation policy which is anti-USA.
27. He says that Japan’s tariff on US goods [one way deal making].
28. He wants to put a tariff on Mexican goods/ all traffic/ cut off aid.
29. Remember when Trump said; we protect Saudi Arabia therefore they must pay.
30. We fought and spend billions in Afghanistan to help those people and China is mining their minerals because the Obama administration is incompetent/ can’t win at negotiating/ stupid leaders.
31. He’s warning America of [Poisons vaccines] and the dangers.
32. He wants a high tech military/ a world class military/ hardware/ hacking/ security [too good to fail].
33. He realizes we have a Muslin problem in this nation.
34. He thinks Obama’s birth certificate is a fraud [check out his SS#, no draft card/ old pass port/ E-verification status, school records [remember his dad isn’t American therefore he isn’t qualified for the office he’s in].
35. He will work for a $1 per year salary, give the rest to charity and not accept the pension after presidency if elected.
SUMMARY
Like him or not, agree with him or not, it doesn’t matter. So far Trump is the only candidate who has shown that he “can up-set the apple-cart” and make things happen and he is exactly what America needs at this point in time! Everybody should do their homework on the candidates. We must not listen to the “political media”. They are not going to tell you the truth! They have a way of twisting words for their own story and agenda! There is an important choice that each voter has to make. Either you cast your vote for another “puppet candidate” and support business as usual in Washington again or support Donald Trump and HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!",496545950518310_496561953850043

If you served with the soldier, you leave a dime. A quarter is very significant because it means that you were there when that soldier died.”

Some Internet research shows that the practice gained attention during the 1960s when Vietnam-era veterans noticed coins appearing on graves. It was said that the coins represented different meanings, from a “down payment” on future beers or entry to a future game of poker.

It’s also reported that a quarter could mean either that someone has stopped by who served in the fallen soldier’s unit or was there during the loss of the soldier’s life. It’s not always the case that a fallen soldier dies around members of his own unit.***                                                                                               Vietnam is what hit me the most in Wars in my generation.  As soon as the boys turned 18...they were drafted, trained, and senst to Vietnam.  Many, many died.  Small towns no longer had any young boys left alive in them.

Please Share:

A man in Iowa wrote this just to let people know how Cruz cheated and what he did to Carson a friend was speaking at a caucus for Carson last night. ..and this is what he went through which Candy Carson also walked in on...I told him I wanted to share his story...so here it is~

""here is what I witnessed last night. I was a guest speaker on behalf of Ben Carson at the Caucus in Altoona at an elementary school and I spoke last night. My pro Carson speech speech included an introduction that I was from one state over in Wisconsin and that my family were Polish immigrants. After my speech was over the Ted Cruz spokeperson made their speech and closed with ""By the way Ben Carson is dropping out of the race"". I got up and shouted ""he's lying"". Immediatelty after that...who walks in? CANDY CARSON! Ben Carson's wife! She backed me up and said it was a lie that Ben was dropping out and not to be deterred. The people then voted and Ben came in 2ND PLACE! Just 8 votes shy of first place. While I was observing the vote count, the Cruz staffers told me ""back up away from the table....you are in OUR state now....go back to Wisconsin you Dumb Polak!""....These are the kind of people that Cruz hires. Remember a couple days before this Cruz sent out mailers to people sharing their neighbor's voting records to shame & embarrass them and pressure them. Ted Cruz is a PHONY ladies and gentlemen. He campaigns as a ""Conservative Christian"" and spreads outright lies in order to to steal a win illegitimately inn an election. He campaigns as a ""fierce protector of privacy rights"" and then sends out mailers withn people's personal voting information to their neighbors, putting them in possible danger. Folks this guy is either a piece of garbage or a complete ignoramus. Take your pick. Either way he is NOT qualified to be the Republican nominee or President of the United States. I hope the American people will realize this man doesn;t have what it takes to face Hillary Clinton in the general election. How is he supposed to attack Hillary for being a liar, dishonest and untrustworthy when he HIMSELF is a liar?! -- Sheryl Leonard, Michiganders for Dr. Ben Carson.

I have seen what is going on in this country we have always been a land of immigrants , but now were dealing with Illegal immigrants and legal ones that have taken or kindness a sign of weakness and are trying to transform our country into their idea of a United States.
Trump know this as most of us do and few will admit it painful as it is we can't  afford to be so kind anymore we can't.
Our very sovereignty is in danger of being distorted by our own kindness and the democrats that are using Illegal immigrants to do it along with a twisting of our constitution in ways I can't began to tell you.
Trump is 100% right we can not Afford to be so nice anymore.

Trump can work with the foreign powers from a point of strength and pride not weakness and stupidity, they may not like dealing with Trump but they will respect him even if they don't see eye to eye but they will for dam sure know we mean business and were not playing around.

The Latinos, blacks and middle eastern prople,  should get on board with Trump and be part of the fixing the problem not keep being the problem because if he is president and I'm petty sure he will be, so all of you are going to take a large dose of the constitution rather you like it or not choose your side wisely my future Americans .

Trump has a special place in his heart for immigrants and loves people that come here and want to be legal Americans his wife was an immigrant and she took the steps to be an Americans  the right way that's all Trump wants and most Americans we want you all here Mexican, Asian , Russian it don't matter we would treat you like one of us always just do it legal that's all we ask of you. us any more we will crush your story's by laughing in your face .",496252940547611_496659043840334

Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much. 

Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William “Bill” Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes. 

Cruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved. 

Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it’s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice. 

Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons. 

Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign. 

In Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back. 

One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn’t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don’t they are in default of their pledge to me. 

I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.",496299333876305_496303147209257

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",496299333876305_496328350540070

2016-02-15T21:34:39+0000,"Republican primary front-runner Donald Trump leads GOP field in South Carolina by 22 points ahead of the next  GOP primary, according to a new poll.

The CBS News “Battleground Tracker” poll released on Sunday morning shows Trump with 42 percent support.

He’s followed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) with 20 percent support, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) with 15 percent support and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who has seen a small surge after his second-place showing in New Hampshire, with 9 percent support.

Cruz wins a plurality of voters who describe themselves as “very conservative,” but trails Trump among conservatives overall and moderate Republicans.

The billionaire businessman is also bolstered by an anti-establishment sentiment in the Palmetto State, with respondents by a four-to-one margin describing the “establishment” as a bad thing.

Just 11 percent said the current crop of politicians in Washington knows how to get things done, while 45 percent said they are tired of business as usual.

The online CBS News poll surveyed 1,315 registered voters in South Carolina. It has a margin of error of 5.7 percent.

His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much. 

Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William “Bill” Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes. 

Cruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved. 

Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it’s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice. 

Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons. 

Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign. 

In Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back. 

One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn’t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don’t they are in default of their pledge to me. 

I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.",496284527211119_496292887210283

Karen:   Ten Reasons for Supporting Trump
1. Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump’s without being able to win at the negotiating table.
3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.
10. Donald Trump loves this country – and says so. He wants to make America great again

2016-02-15T20:55:37+0000,"Why Trump accused GW for not keeping America safe and bringing up 9/11 was b/c Trumps views "" keeping America safe"" are a lot different then GWs.
In Trumps mind...if you have open borders and a visa plan that has failed and allows people who are our enemy in our borders then it's a no win situation ...we're going to lose! and we did when we got hit on 9/11.
People need to look at the bigger picture in why Trump says what he says....its like a tagline when he says something that shakes people up.
There's more to his story then just the tagline.
Trump has the strongest immigration plan for keeping America safe and it does not line up with GWs or anyone else on that stage!! And that's why he said what he said ,bottom line. And I agree with him.
If I owned a home and I hired a babysitter to watch my children and house and under her watch the house was broken into and the kids were killed I certainly wouldn't be calling my babysitter a hero in keeping them safe! would you??
In 1993, there was an attack on the world trade center and for 7 yrs they knew they would do it again. So you'd think they would of secured our borders and visa programs during these years..right?
GW heard rumors mths, and days before the attack and he did nothing. If my house was attacked by rocks or a drive by shooting spree one year and Im still getting threats years later..I think red flags of concern and belief would be instilled in me and Id do what ever I could to protect my house and family.
I think anyone in their right mind would believe the calls and send in the troops. GW didnt!! And that is why Trump says what he says about this subject. GW is not a hero and he did not keep us safe. These are lies to protect his candidacy. And Jeb Bush is banking on those lies for his own candidacy.
And Im glad Trump is bold enough to expose those false statements of what ""safe and being protected"" means to a nation!!",496265680546337_496283020544603

2016-02-15T20:45:49+0000,"Why Trump accused GW for not keeping America safe and bringing up 9/11 was b/c Trumps views "" keeping America safe"" are a lot different then GWs.
In Trumps mind...if you have open borders and a visa plan that has failed and allows people who are our enemy in our borders then it's a no win situation ...we're going to lose! and we did when we got hit on 9/11.
People need to look at the bigger picture in why Trump says what he says....its like a tagline when he says something that shakes people up.
There's more to his story then just the tagline.
Trump has the strongest immigration plan for keeping America safe and it does not line up with GWs or anyone else on that stage!! And that's why he said what he said ,bottom line. And I agree with him.
If I owned a home and I hired a babysitter to watch my children and house and under her watch the house was broken into and the kids were killed I certainly wouldn't be calling my babysitter a hero in keeping them safe! would you??
In 1993, there was an attack on the world trade center and for 7 yrs they knew they would do it again. So you'd think they would of secured our borders and visa programs during these years..right?
GW heard rumors mths, and days before the attack and he did nothing. If my house was attacked by rocks or a drive by shooting spree one year and Im still getting threats years later..I think red flags of concern and belief would be instilled in me and Id do what ever I could to protect my house and family.
I think anyone in their right mind would believe the calls and send in the troops. GW didnt!! And that is why Trump says what he says about this subject. GW is not a hero and he did not keep us safe. These are lies to protect his candidacy. And Jeb Bush is banking on those lies for his own candidacy.
And Im glad Trump is bold enough to expose those false statements of what ""safe and being protected"" means to a nation!!",496232253883013_496281557211416

2016-02-15T20:34:34+0000,"RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 

Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much. 

Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William “Bill” Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes. 

Cruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved. 

Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it’s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice. 

Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons. 

Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign. 

In Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back. 

One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn’t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don’t they are in default of their pledge to me. 

I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.",496231520549753_496277307211841
2016-02-15T20:35:16+0000,"Be careful... I have said much of the following already but this is much more in depth.What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency
By Bill Bennett

They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a
Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.
Don’t be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting
very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary
Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.

It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and
big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this
partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another.
It's one for all and all for one.

It’s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich,
everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We’re the
patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt
crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by
politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of
America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are
all threatened and frightened.

Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary,
the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no
joke.  He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.

It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The
Donald.  It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a
good old boys club. They talk big, but they won’t change a thing. They
are all beholden to big-money donors.

They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental
organizations, and multinational corporations – like Big Pharmacy or Big
Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George
Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton
Foundation donations.

These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by
big money.  But there's one man who isn't beholden to anyone.

There's one man who doesn't need foreigners, or foreign governments, or
George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher's union, or the
Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund
his campaign.

Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn’t need anyone’s help.
That means he doesn’t care what the media says. He doesn’t care what the
corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched
interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can
ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.

Don’t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama?
Don’t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game,
but never actually try to stop Obama?

Don’t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never
tried to defund Obamacare or Obama’s clearly illegal executive action on
amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?

First, I'd guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I
believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are
having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the
National Security Agency knows everything.

Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even
knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank
account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter
government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They
surveil everything.

Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they
are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone
demand his impeachment.

Fourth , why rock the boat?  After defeat or retirement, if you’re a
good old boy, you’ve got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The
big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.

But Trump doesn’t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice,
cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business.
All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other
politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump.

Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama's birth
certificate.  He questioned Obama's college records and how a mediocre
student got into an Ivy League university.  Now, he's doing something no
Republican has the chutzpah to do.  He's questioning our relationship
with Mexico; he's questioning why the border is wide open; he's
questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he's
questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in
our best interests; he's questioning why so many illegal aliens commit
violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he's questioning why our trade
deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.

Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get
the short end of the stick. Good question!

I'm certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion
dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle
Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website.  By
the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion.

Trump will ask if Obamacare's architects can be charged with fraud for
selling it by lying.  Trump will investigate Obama's widespread IRS
conspiracy, not to mention Obama's college records. Trump will prosecute
Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the
election.  How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor
Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs
report before the 2012 election?

Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump.
They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling
the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump
could wake a sleeping giant.

Trump's election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes.
No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate.
Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama's
records, the game is over.

The jig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison.
Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in
prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money.

Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for
accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or
for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for
lying about Benghazi.  The entire upper level management of the IRS
could wind up in prison.

Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up
ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will
prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That’s why the dogs of
hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.

Yes, it's become open season on Donald Trump.

The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his
businesses and if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. 
But they can't silence him. And they sure can't intimidate him.

The more they try, the more the public will realize that he's the one
telling the truth.",496231520549753_496277397211832

Karen:   Ten Reasons for Supporting Trump
1. Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump’s without being able to win at the negotiating table.
3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.
10. Donald Trump loves this country – and says so. He wants to make America great again

George W Bush is campaigning for Jeb Bush, so what is in his background is fair game. Here is a little tidbit on dear George W
Before you go attack someone for using Eminent Domain you better check your family hon. 
Everyone has to read this........................ and please share.
Bush Family Used Eminent Domain
Jeb's brother, George W., who he is using in spots to campaign for him, acquired most of his wealth when the City of Arlington, Texas grabbed homes through eminent domain. Bush could then build a new baseball stadium for the Texas Rangers and an accompanying parking lot, a team then-owned by a group where George W. was the general manager and key partner. You might want to read the article in Pensito Review regarding the shenanigans pulled by George W. The article states, ""This is exactly the sort of gambit used by former Illinois governor Otto Kerner, who was convicted of tax fraud as a result.""Jebby because of actions you took, you cost Florida 16.1 million dollars. WTF!!!!!!
Please read this and share..................JEBBIE doesn't use Eminent Domain! He uses I'm THE SUPREME RULER. Ends up with Florida in class action lawsuits that cost ten of millions!
Jeb's Florida Citrus Debacle
When Jeb was governor of Florida, he ordered backyard citrus trees to all be destroyed without compensation to residents, because of an outbreak of citrus canker disease. This was the largest private property confiscation via eminent domain in the State of Florida. [Link]He not only ordered seizures by force, but it was Bush himself who refused to reimburse the residents for the property he unlawfully ordered to be removed and destroyed.What happened in Florida under Jeb Bush's administration is nothing less than a chipping away at a fundamental guarantee in the Constitution.
""I stood here and watched them take our Ruby Red grapefruit, a Key lime, a Valencia orange and a Calamondin,"" said Coral Gables retiree Walter Jureski, eyes brimming with emotion. ""It was heartbreaking. We loved those trees, and they were loaded with fruit.""For his losses, Jureski, 80, like other homeowners, received a $100 voucher to be used in the garden department at Wal-Mart. But even if there wasn't a ban on replanting citrus, he wouldn't do it. Said Jureski: ""I couldn't stand to go through that again.""The people were violated. They said, ""The Agriculture Department's hired goon squads break down your fences, trample your rights, and destroy private property.""Under an emergency order by Governor Bush, canker crews do not need an owner's permission to walk onto private property and take out citrus trees. Lushly landscaped yards have been reduced to vacant lots in minutes. ""They raped our yard,"" a caller named Lynn told a Miami radio talk-show host. ""I'm horrified, appalled, furious. Just livid.""
Bush’s action is now costing the State of Florida hundreds of millions in lawsuits and legal fees. A south Florida jury has ordered the State of Florida to pay $11.5 million as compensation to 58,225 residents of Broward County. Similar class-action lawsuits took place in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Lee, and Orange Counties. The Palm Beach verdict came in at an estimated $16.1 million reimbursement.",496232533882985_496255010547404

2016-02-15T19:31:42+0000,"Donald Trump is the new Monday (Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday-Friday) morning quarterback, claiming that he was against the Iraq war from the beginning.
Hey Mr. Trump, the entire nation, including the soldiers who served in Iraq were with one voice to bomb Iraq and get rid of Saddam Hessian, people much much brighter then you, chemists who know something about weapons of mass destruction, other nations including Britain and members of the EU and the UN, were informed, shown tests and agreed.
But you Mr. Humpty Dumpty Trumpty, knew better, knows better and are Mr Perfect without failure, as the late President Kennedy said, you learn from mistakes, and since you Mr. Dumpty never made any in your investments, buildings and casino's, you never and will never learn.
We now all agree, the only weapons of mass destruction now, is in Trumps mouth spitting stupidity, venom, hatred, this good-year blimp, will evaporate. The Washington's Post cartoon on Ted Cruz children was just as insulting as Trump's sarcastic remark on Jeb Bush's mother. History will not be made with this rich spoiled brat getting the votes, we already had 2 embarrassing president, Clinton and Obama.",496232533882985_496265430546362

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the official ""Donald Pump"" t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/donaldpump .

George W Bush is campaigning for Jeb Bush, so what is in his background is fair game. Here is a little tidbit on dear George W
Before you go attack someone for using Eminent Domain you better check your family hon. 
Everyone has to read this........................ and please share.
Bush Family Used Eminent Domain
Jeb's brother, George W., who he is using in spots to campaign for him, acquired most of his wealth when the City of Arlington, Texas grabbed homes through eminent domain. Bush could then build a new baseball stadium for the Texas Rangers and an accompanying parking lot, a team then-owned by a group where George W. was the general manager and key partner. You might want to read the article in Pensito Review regarding the shenanigans pulled by George W. The article states, ""This is exactly the sort of gambit used by former Illinois governor Otto Kerner, who was convicted of tax fraud as a result.""Jebby because of actions you took, you cost Florida 16.1 million dollars. WTF!!!!!!
Please read this and share..................JEBBIE doesn't use Eminent Domain! He uses I'm THE SUPREME RULER. Ends up with Florida in class action lawsuits that cost ten of millions!
Jeb's Florida Citrus Debacle
When Jeb was governor of Florida, he ordered backyard citrus trees to all be destroyed without compensation to residents, because of an outbreak of citrus canker disease. This was the largest private property confiscation via eminent domain in the State of Florida. [Link]He not only ordered seizures by force, but it was Bush himself who refused to reimburse the residents for the property he unlawfully ordered to be removed and destroyed.What happened in Florida under Jeb Bush's administration is nothing less than a chipping away at a fundamental guarantee in the Constitution.
""I stood here and watched them take our Ruby Red grapefruit, a Key lime, a Valencia orange and a Calamondin,"" said Coral Gables retiree Walter Jureski, eyes brimming with emotion. ""It was heartbreaking. We loved those trees, and they were loaded with fruit.""For his losses, Jureski, 80, like other homeowners, received a $100 voucher to be used in the garden department at Wal-Mart. But even if there wasn't a ban on replanting citrus, he wouldn't do it. Said Jureski: ""I couldn't stand to go through that again.""The people were violated. They said, ""The Agriculture Department's hired goon squads break down your fences, trample your rights, and destroy private property.""Under an emergency order by Governor Bush, canker crews do not need an owner's permission to walk onto private property and take out citrus trees. Lushly landscaped yards have been reduced to vacant lots in minutes. ""They raped our yard,"" a caller named Lynn told a Miami radio talk-show host. ""I'm horrified, appalled, furious. Just livid.""
Bush’s action is now costing the State of Florida hundreds of millions in lawsuits and legal fees. A south Florida jury has ordered the State of Florida to pay $11.5 million as compensation to 58,225 residents of Broward County. Similar class-action lawsuits took place in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Lee, and Orange Counties. The Palm Beach verdict came in at an estimated $16.1 million reimbursement.",496231263883112_496253617214210

2016-02-14T17:01:30+0000,"As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the official ""Donald Pump"" t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/donaldpump .

2016-02-14T17:02:06+0000,"What exactly does America get in a Donald Trump presidency? Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it. It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great. He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump. No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with half a brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally. Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people. He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",495258733980365_495885350584370

2016-02-14T18:26:22+0000,"Written by a Facebook member...a good read..........I've been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, people say that he doesn't have a platform, that he just wants to make America great again. I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats. That is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald  Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set. This man is prepared in business and it will be prepared when the time is right in a debate. He is a brilliant man, and he will not teveal his hand. He doesn't have to, he has his supporters. They believe in him, they know  he could be the commander in chief and lead this country in the right direction. As far as foreign policy, you say he lacks. What I say is he knows the economy, he knows the about taxes, trade, laws, foreign values, he knows that inside and out because he's dealt with them for so many years. Now if he hadn't been good with dealing with the foreign market, he wouldn't be the billionaire that he is now. He is a international brand. He knows leaders and foreign dignitaries. He is an economic genius with the skills to make this country great again. By bringing businesses back into this country and creating jobs. This will only help our economy. He would protect the United States from those who want to do us harm. He loves this country, and. will do what he has to do to protect it. HE IS bold and brash, he says what he means it means what it says, and that is what we like about him so much. He will be a tough negotiator and our allies will know where he stands at all times. They know his word will mean something, and so will our enemies. This is a brilliant man who has focus and he is pragmatic. He knows how to solve problems quickly. He will surround himself with the best of the best in all branches of the government. You will not see our soldiers kneeling  at the feet of Iranian, nor will you see Isis take over the world. You haven't seen the guy work yet. All you've seen is a businessman turned politician before your eyes. His supporters are standing shoulder to shoulder with him and will not sway. Lobbyist and special interest groups will no longer be able to line that pockets of our Congress and Senate. Because when they do, the Senates and congressmen will pass  a bills anf legislation and it will be a conflict of interest to the United States. No more will you have super PACs running this country. The media can ridicule Donald Trump and his supporters all they want, But we are digging in our heels. We will not be deterred. The fact of the matter is, you think Americans are stupid. But we are the backbone of this country. Americans will determine the vote, not the special special intetest groups or the lobbiests.  They will finally understood clearly. Our voices will be heard.  We will support our troops and build up our military and take care of our vets. Because this administration has not had their backs, nor have they listened to our top military leaders. No longer will our military hands be tied. He will secure our borders and revamp our visa program. He will do everything in his power to keep American safe. He will call our enemies by name, radicals jihadist. There will no longer be political correctness, for it is destroying our country and dividing us. Americans are finally pulling together as one, United we stand, shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump",495258733980365_495915900581315

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting.

2016-02-13T22:05:14+0000,"This is from Wayne Allyn Root for Personal Liberty and it is a MUST-READ.....He wrote a book titled “The Murder of the Middle Class” about the unholy conspiracy between big government, big business and big media. It’s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich — everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We’re the patsies.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it’s in all of their interests to protect one another. It’s one for all and all for one.But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. I’ve never seen them this outraged, this vicious, this motivated or this coordinated. Never in all my years in politics have I seen anything like the way the mad dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.It’s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. No, this is a coordinated conspiracy led by President Barack Obama himself. Obama himself is making the phone calls and giving the orders; he’s the ultimate intimidator who plays by the rules of Chicago thug politics. Why is this so important to Obama? It’s because most of the other politicians are part of the “old boys club.” They talk big, but in the end they won’t change a thing. Why? They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations and multinational corporations like Big Pharma or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary with their Clinton Foundation donations. Don’t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don’t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don’t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to defund Obamacare or Obama’s clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right? Well, first, I’d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything. But Trump doesn’t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides — but not Trump. Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question. I’m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare’s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. He will ask if Obama himself committed fraud when he said, “If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.” Trump will investigate Obama’s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama’s college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at “the cooked books” and Obama’s records, the game is over. The gig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails, or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while secretary of state, or for “misplacing” $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison. Obamacare will be defunded and dismantled. The Obama crime family will be prosecuted for crimes against the American people. And Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved — just for fun. That will all happen on Trump’s first day in the White House.",495226607316911_495627613943477

A man in Iowa wrote this just to let people know how Cruz cheated and what he did to Carson a friend was speaking at a caucus for Carson last night. ..and this is what he went through which Candy Carson also walked in on...I told him I wanted to share his story...so here it is~

""here is what I witnessed last night. I was a guest speaker on behalf of Ben Carson at the Caucus in Altoona at an elementary school and I spoke last night. My pro Carson speech speech included an introduction that I was from one state over in Wisconsin and that my family were Polish immigrants. After my speech was over the Ted Cruz spokeperson made their speech and closed with ""By the way Ben Carson is dropping out of the race"". I got up and shouted ""he's lying"". Immediatelty after that...who walks in? CANDY CARSON! Ben Carson's wife! She backed me up and said it was a lie that Ben was dropping out and not to be deterred. The people then voted and Ben came in 2ND PLACE! Just 8 votes shy of first place. While I was observing the vote count, the Cruz staffers told me ""back up away from the table....you are in OUR state now....go back to Wisconsin you Dumb Polak!""....These are the kind of people that Cruz hires. Remember a couple days before this Cruz sent out mailers to people sharing their neighbor's voting records to shame & embarrass them and pressure them. Ted Cruz is a PHONY ladies and gentlemen. He campaigns as a ""Conservative Christian"" and spreads outright lies in order to to steal a win illegitimately inn an election. He campaigns as a ""fierce protector of privacy rights"" and then sends out mailers withn people's personal voting information to their neighbors, putting them in possible danger. Folks this guy is either a piece of garbage or a complete ignoramus. Take your pick. Either way he is NOT qualified to be the Republican nominee or President of the United States. I hope the American people will realize this man doesn;t have what it takes to face Hillary Clinton in the general election. How is he supposed to attack Hillary for being a liar, dishonest and untrustworthy when he HIMSELF is a liar?! -- Sheryl Leonard, Michiganders for Dr. Ben Carson.

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",495185703987668_495517047287867

2016-02-13T22:58:32+0000,"Voting Democrat is a disease:   I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if our federal government borrows $85 Billion every single month.
I vote Democrat because I care about the children … but saddling them with trillions of dollars of debt to pay for my bloated leftist government is okay.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s better to pay billions of dollars to people who hate us rather than drill for our own oil, because it might upset some endangered beetle or gopher.
I vote Democrat because I believe it is okay if liberal activist judges rewrite the Constitution to suit some fringe kooks, who would otherwise never get their agenda past the voters.
I vote Democrat because I believe that corporate America should not be allowed to make profits for themselves or their shareholders. They need to break even and give the rest to the federal government for redistribution.
I vote Democrat because I’m not concerned about millions of babies being aborted, so long as we keep all of the murderers on death row alive.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if my Nobel Peace Prize winning President uses drones to assassinate people, as long as we don’t use torture.
I vote Democrat because I believe people, who can’t accurately tell us if it will rain on Friday, can predict the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don’t start driving a Chevy Volt.
I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is not as important as preventing people from being offended.
I vote Democrat because I believe the oil companies’ profit of 3% on a gallon of gas is obscene, but the federal government taxing that same gallon of gas at 15% isn’t obscene.
I vote Democrat because I believe a moment of silent prayer at the beginning of the school day constitutes government indoctrination and an intrusion on parental authority ….. but sex education, condom distribution and multiculturalism are all values-neutral.
I vote Democrat because I agonize over threats to the natural environment from CO2, acid rain and toxic waste ….. but I am totally oblivious of the threats to our social environment from pornography, promiscuity and family dissolution.
I vote Democrat because I believe lazy, uneducated stoners should have just as big a say in running our country as entrepreneurs who risk everything and work 70 hours per week.
I vote Democrat because I don’t like guns ….. so no one else should be allowed to own one.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between welfare and the rise of illegitimacy.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between judicial leniency and surging crime rates.
I vote Democrat because I believe you don’t need an ID to vote but you do to buy beer.
I vote Democrat because I believe marriage is obsolete, except for homosexuals.
I vote Democrat because I think AIDS is spread by insufficient funding.
I vote Democrat because I think “fairness” is far more important than freedom.
I vote Democrat because I think an “equal outcome” is far more important than equal opportunity.
I vote democrat because I would rather hide in a class room while others fight for my freedom.
I vote democrat because I’m not smart enough to own a gun and I need someone else to protect me.
I vote democrat because I would rather have free stuff than freedom.
And lastly, I vote Democrat because I’m convinced that government programs are the solution to the human condition, NOT freedom! Trump For President..to TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY from the disease called DemoCRAPs!.....Written By:  Raymond A White",495143227325249_495636090609296

As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Get the official ""Donald Pump"" t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/donaldpump .

2016-02-13T05:23:30+0000,"The color 'PURPLE""  means means no trespassing.  I didn't know this!!!

“It holds the same weight and the same law violations apply. It’s no trespassing period,” Ashley Pellerin, an agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s extension service in Prairie View, Texas, told KETK.    The law began in 1989 in Arkansas as a means for property owners to declare private land. Other states later adopted the law.

In Texas, landowners were constantly replacing “No Trespassing” signs — either by people who didn’t want to acknowledge the signs and tore them down or by those using the signs as target practice said Jonathan Kennedy, landowner and broker.

“People hunting or fishing without the landowner’s consent is a common issue,” said Texas Game Warden Brad Clark.",495117140661191_495357920637113

2016-02-13T05:33:03+0000,"Ugh..OKLAHOMA GETS MEAN & TOUGH!       ***

Oklahoma defines criminal trespassing in Oklahoma Statutes 21-1835. It states that any person who “willfully or maliciously” enters without permission is guilty of trespassing. Penalties of trespassing include fines and possible imprisonment of varying amounts and time. Oklahoma defines “posted” (i.e. to give notice) as “exhibiting signs to read as follows:  “PROPERTY RESTRICTED”; “POSTED – KEEP OUT”; “KEEP OUT”; “NO TRESPASSING”; or similar signs which are displayed. Property that is fenced or not fenced must have such signs placed conspicuously and at all places where entry to the property is normally expected.”***",495117140661191_495360890636816

2016-02-13T16:34:27+0000,"Voting Democrat is a disease:   I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if our federal government borrows $85 Billion every single month.
I vote Democrat because I care about the children … but saddling them with trillions of dollars of debt to pay for my bloated leftist government is okay.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s better to pay billions of dollars to people who hate us rather than drill for our own oil, because it might upset some endangered beetle or gopher.
I vote Democrat because I believe it is okay if liberal activist judges rewrite the Constitution to suit some fringe kooks, who would otherwise never get their agenda past the voters.
I vote Democrat because I believe that corporate America should not be allowed to make profits for themselves or their shareholders. They need to break even and give the rest to the federal government for redistribution.
I vote Democrat because I’m not concerned about millions of babies being aborted, so long as we keep all of the murderers on death row alive.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if my Nobel Peace Prize winning President uses drones to assassinate people, as long as we don’t use torture.
I vote Democrat because I believe people, who can’t accurately tell us if it will rain on Friday, can predict the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don’t start driving a Chevy Volt.
I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is not as important as preventing people from being offended.
I vote Democrat because I believe the oil companies’ profit of 3% on a gallon of gas is obscene, but the federal government taxing that same gallon of gas at 15% isn’t obscene.
I vote Democrat because I believe a moment of silent prayer at the beginning of the school day constitutes government indoctrination and an intrusion on parental authority ….. but sex education, condom distribution and multiculturalism are all values-neutral.
I vote Democrat because I agonize over threats to the natural environment from CO2, acid rain and toxic waste ….. but I am totally oblivious of the threats to our social environment from pornography, promiscuity and family dissolution.
I vote Democrat because I believe lazy, uneducated stoners should have just as big a say in running our country as entrepreneurs who risk everything and work 70 hours per week.
I vote Democrat because I don’t like guns ….. so no one else should be allowed to own one.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between welfare and the rise of illegitimacy.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between judicial leniency and surging crime rates.
I vote Democrat because I believe you don’t need an ID to vote but you do to buy beer.
I vote Democrat because I believe marriage is obsolete, except for homosexuals.
I vote Democrat because I think AIDS is spread by insufficient funding.
I vote Democrat because I think “fairness” is far more important than freedom.
I vote Democrat because I think an “equal outcome” is far more important than equal opportunity.
I vote democrat because I would rather hide in a class room while others fight for my freedom.
I vote democrat because I’m not smart enough to own a gun and I need someone else to protect me.
I vote democrat because I would rather have free stuff than freedom.
And lastly, I vote Democrat because I’m convinced that government programs are the solution to the human condition, NOT freedom! Trump For President..to TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY from the disease called DemoCRAPs!.....Written By:  Raymond A White",495116987327873_495532773952961

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",495118327327739_495224127317159

WE LIVE IN A DANGEROUS WORLD AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HATE US,BECAUSE FROM CONCEPTION OUR DEMACRATIC SOCIETY HAS WORKED AND THRIVED,BUT NOW OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN INFILTRATED BY AN ENEMY WITH PLANS TO RULE THE WORLD AND HAVE A ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT RUN BY A FEW WHILE THE REST OF US WOULD BE  SUBJECT TO THEIR DICTATES,BUT THEY MUST SEE TO THE END OF OUR FREE SOCIETY FIRST, BECAUSE WE OFFER HOPE TO THE WORLD AS LONG AS WE ARE FREE... DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THE EVIDENCE IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

LOOK AT WHO DONATES MONEY TO THE POLITICIANS AND WHO OWNS AND CONTROLS THE MEDIA,MY FRIENDS WE ARE AT WAR AND THE ENEMY IS ON OUR SOIL,WE CAN GIVE THEM OUR WONDERFUL COUNTRY OR WE CAN STAND TOGETHER AND TELL THEM NO NOT EVER AND HOLD HIGH THE RED,WHITE AND BLUE THAT SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE DIED FOR.

I AM AN AMERICAN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MY RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH,WHILE I STILL CAN, ASKING MY FELLOW AMERICANS TO JOIN ME IN THE AMERICAN PARTY AND LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Well you would have to be blind and deaf not to see what Obama has been doing to our country since day one in office. He has made a laughing stock of our country,  as an American President he bowed to a Muslim King. He has turn his back on our great allies, Israel. He has down graded our military,  he has opened our borders for illegals to flood in. He came up with a medical plan that no one can afford, and to get more money out if the American people he fines them for not having insurance,  when he knows no one can afford Obamacare or insurance. He gave Iran billions of dollars, they are building up their nukes and he knows it, and has one intention of stopping them. He says he he using drones against ISIS,  but he hasn't hit one target in 4 years. He has turned loose all the terrorists prisoners,  so they can return to fight us again. Every American that is not so stupid that they want to believe he is great, or not in his support group. We all know he is trying to disarm us, destroy our economy and bring us under control. I have read that there will be no 2016 election. That Obama will cause something catastrophic, to happen in our country so that he can declare martial law.  And he will then by law be able to stay in power as long as he wants. I pray that this is not true. I pray he leaves office and we never see him again. Hillary said she would appoint him to the Supreme Court, ha! Just what we would need. I heard something about him becoming in control of the United nations, something else we would really need.  I just pray that this election,  we elect a President that really does love our country, and will make it great and safe again. May God Bless America",494526630720242_494594240713481

2016-02-11T11:41:31+0000,"""Conservatives should never lower themselves to debate with feminists"".
We can never be too polite, but #conservatives now have a serious problem because we have been “much"" too polite. Rather than laughing #feminists off panels, we have instead opted on far too many questionable occasions, to instead engage in debate with certifiable lunatics in front of global audiences. What we unfortunately sometimes seem to overlook in our own rational minds, is that these people are mentally ill, and that there is absolutely no possibility a “discussion"" will begin, develop into, or end in a rational manner. So what is the end game of such debates? Quite a majority of people on the planet are still practical, they don’t need a conservative point of view to establish that feminists are sick and twisted.

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",494425844063654_494482237391348

2016-02-10T18:35:51+0000,"Voting Democrat is a disease:   I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if our federal government borrows $85 Billion every single month.
I vote Democrat because I care about the children … but saddling them with trillions of dollars of debt to pay for my bloated leftist government is okay.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s better to pay billions of dollars to people who hate us rather than drill for our own oil, because it might upset some endangered beetle or gopher.
I vote Democrat because I believe it is okay if liberal activist judges rewrite the Constitution to suit some fringe kooks, who would otherwise never get their agenda past the voters.
I vote Democrat because I believe that corporate America should not be allowed to make profits for themselves or their shareholders. They need to break even and give the rest to the federal government for redistribution.
I vote Democrat because I’m not concerned about millions of babies being aborted, so long as we keep all of the murderers on death row alive.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if my Nobel Peace Prize winning President uses drones to assassinate people, as long as we don’t use torture.
I vote Democrat because I believe people, who can’t accurately tell us if it will rain on Friday, can predict the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don’t start driving a Chevy Volt.
I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is not as important as preventing people from being offended.
I vote Democrat because I believe the oil companies’ profit of 3% on a gallon of gas is obscene, but the federal government taxing that same gallon of gas at 15% isn’t obscene.
I vote Democrat because I believe a moment of silent prayer at the beginning of the school day constitutes government indoctrination and an intrusion on parental authority ….. but sex education, condom distribution and multiculturalism are all values-neutral.
I vote Democrat because I agonize over threats to the natural environment from CO2, acid rain and toxic waste ….. but I am totally oblivious of the threats to our social environment from pornography, promiscuity and family dissolution.
I vote Democrat because I believe lazy, uneducated stoners should have just as big a say in running our country as entrepreneurs who risk everything and work 70 hours per week.
I vote Democrat because I don’t like guns ….. so no one else should be allowed to own one.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between welfare and the rise of illegitimacy.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between judicial leniency and surging crime rates.
I vote Democrat because I believe you don’t need an ID to vote but you do to buy beer.
I vote Democrat because I believe marriage is obsolete, except for homosexuals.
I vote Democrat because I think AIDS is spread by insufficient funding.

Subj: interesting take on Trump

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",494401764066062_494454074060831

2016-02-10T17:14:18+0000,"This is from Wayne Allyn Root for Personal Liberty and it is a MUST-READ.....He wrote a book titled “The Murder of the Middle Class” about the unholy conspiracy between big government, big business and big media. It’s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich — everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We’re the patsies.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it’s in all of their interests to protect one another. It’s one for all and all for one.But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. I’ve never seen them this outraged, this vicious, this motivated or this coordinated. Never in all my years in politics have I seen anything like the way the mad dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.It’s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. No, this is a coordinated conspiracy led by President Barack Obama himself. Obama himself is making the phone calls and giving the orders; he’s the ultimate intimidator who plays by the rules of Chicago thug politics. Why is this so important to Obama? It’s because most of the other politicians are part of the “old boys club.” They talk big, but in the end they won’t change a thing. Why? They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations and multinational corporations like Big Pharma or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary with their Clinton Foundation donations. Don’t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don’t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don’t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to defund Obamacare or Obama’s clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right? Well, first, I’d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything. But Trump doesn’t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides — but not Trump. Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question. I’m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare’s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. He will ask if Obama himself committed fraud when he said, “If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.” Trump will investigate Obama’s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama’s college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at “the cooked books” and Obama’s records, the game is over. The gig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails, or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while secretary of state, or for “misplacing” $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison. Obamacare will be defunded and dismantled. The Obama crime family will be prosecuted for crimes against the American people. And Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved — just for fun. That will all happen on Trump’s first day in the White House.",494405374065701_494427464063492

2016-02-10T06:17:05+0000,"My American friends, remember when voting...""There is right, and there is wrong. Don’t call it cultural diversity"".

#Rape, #murder, honour killings, #genocide and #pedophilia are not traits of #cultural diversity. They are crimes. And these are acceptable crimes in the societies of the refugees which are currently flooding the western world. Now, the vast majority of these refugees may be ""law abiding"" citizens in context of the laws within their own countries, but what does that actually mean? How is it relevant to respecting civilised law? These people are indoctrinated from birth to embrace practices that we simply consider horrific. So how is welcoming #refugees with open arms really going to work out for us? Quite horrifically. Because it seems more a matter of a fanatical socialist need to impress others with a demented and dangerously ignorant view of what constitutes compassion. The seeds planted from years of #socialist indoctrination in our #education system are now flourishing.

2016-02-10T03:29:53+0000,"Donald J. Trump    Jeb Bush is WRONG about Florida's Eminent Domain being against the law, that they made laws to stop that... THAT IS BULLSHIT!!  I am a 60 year old native born Floridian and I know of many people that lost their land because Florida wanted to widen road or build new neighborhoods. Many fought the state for years and had to hire attorneys because the State of Florida wanted to give them peanuts for prime commercial property. I person know one, an ex-family member who had to fight the State of Florida because they were pulling Eminent Domain on people owning property on Blanding Blvd (AKA State Road 21) in Middle Florida to widen the road. The state wanted to pay peanuts of approx $39,000 for 5 acres of prime land, she fought and received approx $90,000 after attorneys fees, still peanuts because the land was on a major road (widen to 6 lanes) which commercial property value would be at the least 5x's that.
**** To Top this all off.. and you may need to check the records, but I am about 90% positive that Jeb Bush was governor at the time they tried to steal the land on Blanding Blvd, aka SR21, in Middleburg Florida****
ALSO...The homeowners in my area, BrownsLanding in Putnam Country, Palatka Florida, have been fighting the city and county for over 10 years about a 1244 acre parcel that the city wants to annex and let a developer build 6000 homes with a one way entrance off a two lane road that would have to be widened by claiming Eminent Domain and take more than 8 blocks (2 miles) of approx 100+ homes (some in the county and most in the city, including part of the only golf coarse in Putnam Country), and having all these homes and new road would cause flooding of homes (like mine) south of the development to the river. Homeowners should not have to fight the City/County or State because they want to break their own laws...
SO....Jeb Bush flat lied about Eminent Domain laws in Florida because when the State wants something they are willing to break their own laws to get it and throw its citizens under the bus, and most of those citizen are retired elderly and cannot afford to fight or can't because of their health...",494127527426819_494218200751085

DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT AWAY TO STOP THE CORRUPTION IN THE CAPITAL OR AT LEAST HAVE  SPOKEN UP TO WARN US BEFORE NOW ABOUT WHAT THEY KNEW WAS HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND IN BACK ROOMS.

WELL BOYS AND GIRLS THERE IS PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND BECAUSE  IF YOU WERE ELECTED TO REPRESENT OTHERS IN WASHINGTON DC AND ALLOWED THE CORRUPTION TO GO UNCHECKED OR DIDN'T BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others created ""Chepo Team"", the first true pro-America, comic strip. Please support our cause by liking our facebook page at:www.facebook.com/chepoteam .

I agree with Trump, its upward of 25% and underemployment is also high.  Maybe as high as 30%.  People are hurting but still support the politicians who will do nothing about it because they can't.  They created the mess we are in.  They simply do not know what they are doing.  Its time to change that.  Lets explode the employment and bring our jobs home.

As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama.

2016-02-09T04:19:07+0000,I respect all police officers but even though she might've handled it wrong in the first place officers are not above the law to do is a feel fit if they're wanting to set an example to citizens they have to be an example to as well an be an example they need to set is a positive one. And they might not of liked what she did and I can understand that but also what they did was be vindictive and was getting back at her and in a negative way that is  kind of like harassment and I don't think police officers should do that,493813757458196_493902770782628

2016-02-09T05:32:31+0000,the best way to get along with cops is don't piss them off leave cops alone. if cops break the law let them break the law. that way you stay on the good side of the law. cops always wins even if cops are in the wrong and your in the right. when it comes to cops you are aways fighting a losing battle. if a cop can gun down a unarmed boy. with pictures and video showing the cop killing a unarmed boy. and the cop still gets away with it. that should show you that cops are above the law. and it should show you do not piss them off. lucky for her she is still alive after pissing that cops off.,493813757458196_493914640781441

2016-02-09T08:17:06+0000,"Chuck Norris
Clinton is due to receive the Cloward-Piven baton from Barack Obama and actually ran in the same circles as Obama. The current President has been affiliated with radicals such as Bill Ayers, Saul Alinsky, Bernardine Dohrn, George Wiley, Frank Marshall Davis, and Wade Rathke.

The young Hillary Clinton actually wrote a 92-page thesis paper about Saul Alinsky, and professed a deep infatuation and admiration for the “old radical from Chicago.”

Sounds bad right? Well, it gets worse. President Clinton signed the Motor Voter Registration Act into law and actually had Cloward standing behind him when he did. This underhanded tactic actually was a way to allow illegal aliens to get drivers licenses and have the right to vote!

By espousing marxist ideals and allowing illegal aliens voting access, the plan was put into place to turn the traditional model of the United States that has worked for centuries into a marxist, socialist no-mans land.

Chuck Norris is a man who loves his country, and he doesn’t want to see it destroyed within. He has read between the lines and sees Hillary Clinton for what she is, a dishonest con woman that wants nothing more than to continue Obama’s tyranny and ruin our country!

WHY ......... would Hillary and Bill Clinton have a relationship with the World’s ‘Most Dangerous Islamist’ Alive, Well, and Living in Pennsylvania? Why does he have a worldwide network of media organizations and charter schools — some 120 of which are in the U.S.? Whistleblowers have come forward to shed light on how taxpayer-funded Gulen charter schools in the U.S. are operated.

Whistleblowers have claimed that teachers proselytize to American students about the Gulen movement, which is considered to espouse a moderate form of Islam. He also said that teachers in those schools have claimed that Turkish teachers are given bonuses based on their indoctrination efforts. The ultimate reward is a trip to Gulen’s Pocono compound.

Why are American taxpayers paying for it ? Why is there really no news coverage  ?

2016-02-09T09:36:51+0000,"Chuck Norris
Clinton is due to receive the Cloward-Piven baton from Barack Obama and actually ran in the same circles as Obama. The current President has been affiliated with radicals such as Bill Ayers, Saul Alinsky, Bernardine Dohrn, George Wiley, Frank Marshall Davis, and Wade Rathke.

The young Hillary Clinton actually wrote a 92-page thesis paper about Saul Alinsky, and professed a deep infatuation and admiration for the “old radical from Chicago.”

Sounds bad right? Well, it gets worse. President Clinton signed the Motor Voter Registration Act into law and actually had Cloward standing behind him when he did. This underhanded tactic actually was a way to allow illegal aliens to get drivers licenses and have the right to vote!

By espousing marxist ideals and allowing illegal aliens voting access, the plan was put into place to turn the traditional model of the United States that has worked for centuries into a marxist, socialist no-mans land.

Chuck Norris is a man who loves his country, and he doesn’t want to see it destroyed within. He has read between the lines and sees Hillary Clinton for what she is, a dishonest con woman that wants nothing more than to continue Obama’s tyranny and ruin our country!

Both true.  However, what Trump is really doing is simultaneously exposing the entire sordid, corrupt, self-serving, financial manipulative scheme -within a national political construct- that has remained hidden just beneath the surface…..…a horribly corrupt beast, fed by an oblivious electorate. A behemoth, made of media and various news outlets, who serves the financial needs of left and right-wing talking heads, and exists exclusively to keep them in power.
For years we have called those who control this monster: “The Decepticons”. Professional deceivers who exist exclusively for their own scheme and graft.

I vote Democrat because I believe it’s better to pay billions of dollars to people who hate us rather than drill for our own oil, because it might upset some endangered beetle or gopher.
I vote Democrat because I believe it is okay if liberal activist judges rewrite the Constitution to suit some fringe kooks, who would otherwise never get their agenda past the voters.
I vote Democrat because I believe that corporate America should not be allowed to make profits for themselves or their shareholders. They need to break even and give the rest to the federal government for redistribution.
I vote Democrat because I’m not concerned about millions of babies being aborted, so long as we keep all of the murderers on death row alive.
I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if my Nobel Peace Prize winning President uses drones to assassinate people, as long as we don’t use torture.
I vote Democrat because I believe people, who can’t accurately tell us if it will rain on Friday, can predict the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don’t start driving a Chevy Volt.
I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is not as important as preventing people from being offended.
I vote Democrat because I believe the oil companies’ profit of 3% on a gallon of gas is obscene, but the federal government taxing that same gallon of gas at 15% isn’t obscene.
I vote Democrat because I believe a moment of silent prayer at the beginning of the school day constitutes government indoctrination and an intrusion on parental authority ….. but sex education, condom distribution and multiculturalism are all values-neutral.
I vote Democrat because I agonize over threats to the natural environment from CO2, acid rain and toxic waste ….. but I am totally oblivious of the threats to our social environment from pornography, promiscuity and family dissolution.
I vote Democrat because I believe lazy, uneducated stoners should have just as big a say in running our country as entrepreneurs who risk everything and work 70 hours per week.
I vote Democrat because I don’t like guns ….. so no one else should be allowed to own one.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between welfare and the rise of illegitimacy.
I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between judicial leniency and surging crime rates.

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",493746607464911_493831280789777

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

Does the NFL promote racism by permitting an ""entertainer"" to attempt to elevate the Black Panthers to some sort of community activist organization that forms the foundation for Black Lives Matter? Doubt it.  They weren't paying any attention to the material that was going to be performed.  The NFL was busy counting the money it earned from $68 parking fees and $1400 a seat to see a football game (more money than a lot of people make in a month!)  If the NFL believed that black lives matter there would be no football because the injuries the game promotes cause severe injuries including brain damage.  In fact, (see Pro Bowl complaints) when the players don't try to crush the other team, the audience is disappointed.

The reason it is pertinent to understand exactly what type of monster Soros is, is that he is an expert in using race as a means to control the political field.
Now add in the Bush factor… NITAF is under the umbrella of the National Immigration Forum which is led by none other than Jeb Bush, Jr. Spending a reported $750,000 for the 60 second ad spot during the primetime debate, this move shows exactly how special interests rig elections…Step 1: Make the front runner and like-minded candidates appear as radicals, Step 2: Make your candidate appear as the voice of reason… You have to sign in to watch the video.  http://iotwreport.com/what-do-jeb-bush-jr-and-george-soros-have-in-common/#KFIzFpDbKr5syhmy.99/

As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting.

I can solve this issue and put it to rest if three rules and a tweek were implimented and I'm not a professional politician. Rule #1 ...... people with mental issues deemed violent should not be allowed to own or carry a firearm.  Rule # 2.......all firearms shall be equipped with smart triggers that only operate for the owner of the weapon. Rule #3..... make tasers legal for those who don't believe in deadly force. There you go, it is just that simple. A bit of fine tuning with laws that prohibit law suits and I truly believe violent crime can be reduced by 50%.",492863597553212_493136554192583

2016-02-06T22:40:40+0000,"Happy Birthday Ronald Reagan

As an actor he wasn’t the best 
But he knew how to feather his nest 
And be nicely connected 
To get him elected
To govern a State way out west 

After college young Ronnie began 
Being paid as a radio man 
He was covering sports 
On the fields and the courts 
But an acting career was his plan

In the 30’s he moved to L.A. 
Where a jury acquitted O.J
Soon he landed some parts 
With his thespian smarts  
In the era of Tessie O'Shea 

Reagan ratted on many he thought 
Were involved in a Communist plot 
To take over the nation 
With socialization 
Which he was determined to stop 

He lost in two federal elections 
But he made some enduring impressions
Then he served the elite 
As Commandeer-in-Chief
When too old to get many erections 

In The White House he served for 8 years 
In the decade of Dallas and Cheers
He was known as a hawk 
He survived getting shot 
And was loved by his minions and peers

He demanded the Russians tear down 
A wall that divided the town 
Of Berlin since the war
Now it’s standing no more 
Since a peaceful solution was found 

Then the Contra affair came to light 
With the Senate and Congress uptight 
About bullets and guns 
Bought with taxpayer funds 
For an unconstitutional fight 

Reagan claimed that he couldn’t recall 
Doing anything shady at all 
With a wink and a nod 
His dim-witted facade 
Led to Weinberger taking the fall 

Reaganomics was something conceived 
By this man who obtusely believed 
That by helping the rich 
Put more cash in their mitts 
Fiscal woes could be nicely relieved 

Near the end of his time in D.C. 
Reagan rarely appeared on TV 
He took numerous naps
And more time to relax 
Knowing soon he'd be footloose and free 

So I wish Happy Day and Godspeed 
To a man who was destined to lead 
With the charm that he had 
And his gift of the gab 
And unstoppable will to succeed",492863597553212_493182134188025

2016-02-06T04:59:54+0000,"""""Trump briefly halted his address to respond to the disruptive woman, stating, “The backbone of our country? I don’t think so, darling.” He further added, to wild applause:

    “You know what the backbone of our country is? People that came to this country legally and they worked their a** off and they’ve made the country great. That’s the backbone.”

The back and forth comes in the aftermath of the disclosure of an Obama administration directive calling for border patrol agents to “catch and release” illegal immigrants instead of arresting them for deportation, justifying the decision with the excuse that not enough of those caught show up for their scheduled deportation hearings. A defiant border agent who testified before Congress claims the directive is a license for illegal aliens to stay in the country.""    THIS IS CRAPPY OBAMA...

Just about everyone would have a job if u get off ur lazy ass and work, instead of depending on ur government hand out and states welfare program. And further more the states should drug test everyone that on welfare and food stamps.

2016-02-06T07:42:45+0000,"Interesting take on Donald Trump

Former U. S. Secretary of Education , William J. Bennett's frankly candid and shocking observations of Donald Trump's impact on the behavior of the entrenched Washington D.C. bureaucrats in both parties -- and the risk The Donald faces in so doing.

William J. Bennett, Host of Bill Bennett's Morning in America Show, is one of America's most important, influential, and respected voices on cultural, political, and education issues.   He has one of the strongest Christian world views of any writer in modern times.

What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency

By Bill Bennett

They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.  Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.

It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one.

It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.

Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together
to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the good old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations - like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.

These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. 

But there's one man who isn't beholden to anyone There's one man who doesn't need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher's union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.

Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn't need anyone's help. That means he doesn't care what the media says. He doesn't care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.

Don't you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don't you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don't you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to de-fund Obamacare or Obama's clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?

First, I'd guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.

Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth, why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you're a good old boy, you've got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.

But Trump doesn't play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy, relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama's birth certificate. He questioned Obama's college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he's doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He's questioning our relationship with Mexico; he's questioning why the border is wide open; he's questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he's questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he's questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he's questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.

Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I'm certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare's architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama's widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama's college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?

Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump's election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama's records, the game is over. The jig is up. The goose is
cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. 

Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi.  The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison. Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That's why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.

Yes, it's become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can't silence him. And they sure can't intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he's the one telling the truth.",492848117554760_492963814209857

""The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al Qaida. And any informed intelligence officer knows this.

""But there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an identified entity representing the 'devil' only in order to drive the TV watcher to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism.

""The country behind this propaganda is the US . . .""

A man in Iowa wrote this just to let people know how Cruz cheated and what he did to Carson a friend was speaking at a caucus for Carson last night. ..and this is what he went through which Candy Carson also walked in on...I told him I wanted to share his story...so here it is~

""here is what I witnessed last night. I was a guest speaker on behalf of Ben Carson at the Caucus in Altoona at an elementary school and I spoke last night. My pro Carson speech speech included an introduction that I was from one state over in Wisconsin and that my family were Polish immigrants. After my speech was over the Ted Cruz spokeperson made their speech and closed with ""By the way Ben Carson is dropping out of the race"". I got up and shouted ""he's lying"". Immediatelty after that...who walks in? CANDY CARSON! Ben Carson's wife! She backed me up and said it was a lie that Ben was dropping out and not to be deterred. The people then voted and Ben came in 2ND PLACE! Just 8 votes shy of first place. While I was observing the vote count, the Cruz staffers told me ""back up away from the table....you are in OUR state now....go back to Wisconsin you Dumb Polak!""....These are the kind of people that Cruz hires. Remember a couple days before this Cruz sent out mailers to people sharing their neighbor's voting records to shame & embarrass them and pressure them. Ted Cruz is a PHONY ladies and gentlemen. He campaigns as a ""Conservative Christian"" and spreads outright lies in order to to steal a win illegitimately inn an election. He campaigns as a ""fierce protector of privacy rights"" and then sends out mailers withn people's personal voting information to their neighbors, putting them in possible danger. Folks this guy is either a piece of garbage or a complete ignoramus. Take your pick. Either way he is NOT qualified to be the Republican nominee or President of the United States. I hope the American people will realize this man doesn;t have what it takes to face Hillary Clinton in the general election. How is he supposed to attack Hillary for being a liar, dishonest and untrustworthy when he HIMSELF is a liar?! -- Sheryl Leonard, Michiganders for Dr. Ben Carson.

2016-02-05T19:07:19+0000,"January 29-31, 2016 -- WMR REPORTING FROM FLORIDA -- Rubio's coke house, gayish dance troupe, and foam parties

Republican insiders have reported to WMR that Florida Senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio was, as a high school and college student, known to be a very extroverted homosexual in both South Beach in Miami, a popular gay area, and at college in Gainesville, Florida.

In 1989, a year before Rubio was arrested with his friend Angel Barrios and another unidentified male friend in Alice Wainwright Park in south Miami, ostensibly for drinking beer in a car after closing time in a park known as a pickup locale for gays, Rubio sang and danced in a South Miami High School troupe. The song and dance troupe was based on the Chippendales but with a very gay theme: half Chippendales and half Village People. Rubio omitted his participation in the dance troupe in his biography, ""American Son.""

It is also significant that Rubio did not have the best parent models in growing up in Florida and Las Vegas. His Cuban parents, according to GOP insiders, did not emigrate from Cuba to escape Fidel Castro and Communism -- they left Cuba for America in 1956 -- but were Havana casino workers employed by Jewish mob boss Meyer Lansky and brought to Florida. From Miami, they eventually left for Las Vegas to work in mob-owned casino hotels. Rubio's father, Mario Rubio Reina, worked as a bartender in Las Vegas casinos while his mother, Oriales Rubio, was a hotel maid. Rubio has falsely claimed that his parents fled Castro and Communism. In 1956, the U.S.-supported fascist dictator, Fulgencio Batista, was fully in control of Cuba.

After flunking out of Tarkeo College in Missouri, Rubio returned to Miami where he hung around with his old high school friend Barrios. Barrios started an on-line gay porn business called Flava Works, which is still in business today live streaming sexual acts between black and Latino men. 

Marco Rubio, 1989, dancing and singing in a South Miami troupe that combined the Chippendales with The Village People.

In order to prepare for the University of Florida, Rubio attended Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville. Republican sources have told WMR that Rubio, Barrios, and two other students shared a townhouse in Gainesville that was known locally as a ""coke house,"" where cocaine was readily available, as were almost non-stop parties in what amounted to an off-campus gay frat house. In 1987, Rubio's brother-in-law, Orlando Cicilia, was busted by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his role as a key figure in a cocaine smuggling ring in south Florida.

After graduating from the University of Florida, Rubio attended the University of Miami Law School. In 1995, Rubio claims he met his wife, Miami Dolphins cheerleader Jeanette Dousdebes at a ""foam party"" in South Beach. There is one thing wrong with Rubio's story: foam parties in South Beach were almost exclusively gay events held at gay clubs like ""Warsaw Ballroom"" and ""Amnesia,"" the latter name befitting some of Rubio's memories of his time in Miami. The following is a description of foam parties in a Miami New Times article by reporter Steven Almond, titled ""Foam Sex,"" published in the June 8, 1995 issue:

""The scene generally features several hundred scantily clad bodies packed onto a dance floor and writhing to bone-rattling music under strobes and colored lights. Nothing new, right? Until suds come gushing out of a machine suspended over the dance floor. As if on cue, various forms of passionate embrace begin. Kissing. Petting. Rubbing. Because the foam froths up waist high, it acts both as a lubricant and camouflage. Mutual masturbation is an occasional component, generally beneath the cover of foam. As the evening wears on, a few men pair off and sit together in the foam that builds up outside the partitioned-off area.""

Although he is obscured by the man in front of him, Marco Rubio [arrow pointing to him] is believed to be in this 1995 photo of a gay South Beach foam party held at the Warsaw Ballroom. Rubio claims he met his wife at one such foam party in 1995.

At ""Amnesia,"" emcee ""Kitty Meow, a drag queen, would officiate over the foam parties, directing participants what to do. Some foam party participants only wore jock straps. It is entirely possible that Rubio did meet his future wife at a foam party, but the women who attended these functions were largely what are known as ""fag hags"" out to have a good time while at the same time avoid being hit on by the gay men.",492814914224747_492827154223523

Ask him who is funding his campaign ...then you will realize who youre really voting for! Hint: its not Rubio !! or any other candidate that is bought by the lobbyists.

2016-02-05T05:23:31+0000,"I had to make a poster so people would understand how Washington works....

I notice that most people in America dont understand how the system works behind the scenes, otherwise the minute Mr. Trump said ""I am self funding my campaign"" they would of known what this serious decision entailed..and they would of rushed behind him and stood with him for the last 7 mths without doubting their decision.

Dont get me wrong...many have backed Trump which is great but I think there should be millions of people instead of thousands. The voters examine each candidate and hear their views and then make a decision based on that and lately Im hearing that they're looking for a candidate that is ""conservative"" enough for them.

And ignoring the fact ""Trump is self funding his campaign!!""

Meaning, there's No one pulling his strings!!. No one controlling him!!....No favors to be made...Only to work for the American people and ignoring the Elite ...Wow...just think how much work can be done!! 

He ignored the lobbyist..he ignored the millions of dollars for his campaign from corporations that want favors.

He loves America and he genuinely wants America great again. He wants to work for the American people...he knows where the mistakes are made and he wants to fix them.

We're a bankrupt country, so he wants to get rid of unnecessary spending ...there's so much work to do but he promises that he will fix where its corrupt and be honest with the people. Hes ready to clean up the mess and straighten it out.

If you love him of hate him....he will undo all the damage that has been done to our country.

Enjoy the poster and please share it w/ your family and friends.",492562357583336_492639907575581

2016-02-05T13:48:48+0000,"Think about it America! Obama came into office, before Obama there was virtually no ""visible"" in your face presence of Islam in America. All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools and businesses. All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in public places and institutions. All of a sudden we are inundated with lawsuits by Muslims who are offended by America and our ways (For God's sake, they are IN America) All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn anywhere and everywhere even though you have no idea who is covered up under them. All of a sudden Muslim training compounds are popping up throughout the USA. All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers for being expected to do their jobs like everyone else, All of a sudden all of our aircraft carriers are recalled for ""maintenance"" by Obama rendering the Atlantic unsupported. All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from the middle east. All of a sudden there is no money for America's poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for obamas refugee programs. All of a sudden Obama fills the Federal Government with Muslims in key positions. All of a sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA. All of a sudden Americans are threatened by the Federal government for complaining about Muslims. All of a sudden Obama's number one concern is to disarm American Citizens. Now, why is it so important for Obama to disarm America? Why? Because a disarmed country is ripe for the takeover by the Muslim Army that Obama has imported into the United States. Nikita Krueschev, the Russian Dictator who visited the USA in the 1950s said the USA could never be occupied by any army because of it's citizen Army. Obama knows this fact and is doing everything within his power to disarm our Citizen Army. If Obama can't do it legally, he will abuse his power and take every gun from every American because he knows he must do that to turn the USA over to Islam. Be wary and watchful. Obama's actions speak louder and far beyond his words. Obama won't even say the words ""Islamic Terrorist"", WHY?"".. I could add a few myself...obama is dead-set on freeing every terrorist and closing GItmo. Why? For the first time in my personal life, I am fearful for the future of my country. Why? For the first time in my life, America is not respected by world leaders. Why? Because obama wants to destroy America from within, along with merkel destroying Germany. They want a new world order and it's called the Illiminati! He is trying to get the appointment of the Head of the UN after his Term. Think about it America!

As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others created ""Chepo Team"", the first true pro-America, comic strip. Please support our cause by liking our facebook page at:www.facebook.com/chepoteam .

2016-02-04T23:31:58+0000,"I have been giving serious and thoughtful consideration to what America gets in a Donald Trump presidency. Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it. It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great. He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump. No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with a half brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally. Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people. He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",492528430920062_492575527582019

2016-02-04T23:50:19+0000,"Sent from my iPad.    Trump vs. Cruz
Here are the facts on Trump vs. Cruz....

The fact is Cruz has been a government parasite his entire adult life, working in one government legal office or another. 

Cruz has ZERO executive experience! 

Cruz is two years into his first term as Texas' junior senator, nearly all of which he has spent running for president, neglecting his duties to the people of Texas.

Cruz's 2016 resume is nearly identical to Barack Hussein's 2008 resume. How has that worked out for you? 

Cruz has a horrible attendance record at senate roll calls. 

Cruz has spent the past two years pissing off nearly everyone in Washington, including most Republicans.

Cruz’s time in the senate thus far has been marked by failure. Bitching about Democrats is NOT an accomplishment.

To Cruz's credit, he has tried on several occasions to stop Democrat legislation. He failed miserably EACH AND EVERY TIME! Do you really want an habitual failure as president? Really? Like I said, bitching is not an accomplishment.

I am getting a little queasy with the term ""conservative"" these days. It doesn't really define anything. It tends to be clung to by the extreme right and those who believe their president should be a very religious man. Nonsense! I don't personally care about a president's religion, or lack thereof. I care that he is a stone cold patriot! I believe very much in the separation of church and state. If you want to live in a theocracy, move to Iran!

Cruz has had his hand out his entire adult life, enjoying his government paycheck, never having to take responsibility for anything. 

Cruz's support begins and ends with the Tea Party, and there it will die. Outside the Tea Party, Cruz is a virtual nobody.

Now juxtapose Cruz's record with Donald Trump's.

Trump is a multibazillionaire for a reason. He KNOWS how to build prosperity. It oozes from his pores. Wouldn't you like a more free and prosperous future for yourself, your children, and grandchildren?

Trump is a self-made man. He commands a humongous company with tens of thousands of employees.

This is EXTREMELY important! Trump has had a lifetime of P&L executive leadership. P&L is where the rubber meets the road!

Trump is a patriot! Some say in their whiney voices, ""But, but, but Trump is not a conservative."" Only a certified moron would say that! Look at Trump's platform. As stated, I get a little queasy with the term ""conservative"" these days. However, if Trump isn't a conservative, then neither is border security, a balanced budget, trade reform, a strong military, putting the screws on Iran, obliterating ISIS, trade reform, repealing Obamacare, etc., etc., etc. 

I could go on and on. Bottom line - Trump is a lifelong, experienced winner! Cruz is a government parasite loser with no executive experience whatsoever!",492482164258022_492578087581763

2016-02-04T21:33:27+0000,"Trump's Battle with Corrupt Media and Party Lines.....Trump is not just taking on the construct of progressive ideology that has undermined the essence of American exceptionalism; Trump is not just exposing the immense number of faux-conservatives in media and political punditry; Trump is not just allowing us to see the scope of anti-American interest; no, he’s taking on the very selfish foundation they’ve used to sell out our country.The bottom line is Donald Trump is advocating for us; he’s representing the interests of all of us who are sick and tired of being lied to and manipulated by the Mitch McConnells of the world. So while campaigning, he’s taking them head on. Donald Trump has now taken enough positions for us to clearly identify that he is indeed our friend, and as a consequence their enemy. Just look at what he has exposed in the two months since he announced. He’s done this simply by putting sunlight on issues and taking firm stances that all others in/around the same issues have apparently lied about for years. Donald Trump, a serious student of the entire decades long game, is waging a 360° war against the entire GOPe apparatus, on every single level of its construct. And yes, that also means the monolithic media empire which facilitates all of the aforementioned usurpations. In that regard, Rupert Murdoch FOX owner is part of the problem. So too Roger Ailes Fox News President is also part of the problem…. again, their interests – i.e., elect Jeb Bush- are antithetical to those of a restored, strong, free and independent U.S. Mitch McConnell, Rupert Murdoch, The RNC, Roger Ailes, Tom Donohue, Wall Street et al, are all part of the apparatus simultaneously being confronted. Trump is talking about, and, well, actually he’s doing more than talking about it, he’s taking on BIG ideological entities that have embedded themselves inside the body politic. Just like exposing the real motivation behind the RNC, or Mitch McConnell, or the NRSC in 2014’s Mississippi primary, Trump is exposing the sordid and corrupt world of the U.S. legacy media. However, better than merely exposing them, he’s taking them head-on. Trump would rather face an enemy who genuinely opposes him, MSNBC and CNN, than deal with the likes of a enemy who puts on the mask of being favorable toward him while simultaneously working diligently to eliminate him. As a consequence of the specific forethought, and after deciding it’s better to have an honest enemy, Mr. Trump is now in the position of tearing down the pillars of Roger Ailes creation. And, as evidence of Trumps’ strength therein, Roger Ailes’ responses reflect a reality that Ailes views this ENEMY, unlike any other enemy, because Trump holds Samson-like capabilities. But Trump is saying he’d rather confront an honest opponent who he knows hates him, than walk into a dishonest interview unsure of their masked ‘angle’. Donald Trump’s greatest weapon is not his money, his wealth, or his keen and astute business acumen, those are all simply tools he’s developed over a lifetime. No, his greatest weapon against these ideological foes is something we shared on the very first day of his candidacy….The American Citizen! ""Posted by Sundance""",492481567591415_492550097584562
2016-02-04T21:35:04+0000,"This actually helps Cruz's case because his letter doesn't say drop out, it says time off/break. Which is exactly what CNN said in a tweet, look at the top tweet from CNN itself, that Carson would be taking a break, and that was their TV headline as well on their channel, Carson is taking a break. Everyone knows CNN started it, and Rubio also pushed this. And actually, one of Carson's staffers told CNN that Carson was taking a break, and that's how they got the story. So actually if anything, Carson's own staffer shot his own general with giving faulty incomplete info to CNN. Cruz, and Rubio as well, merely only said what CNN did. Actually I think Rubio's side said he was out, could be wrong on that, Cruz only said he is taking a break like the headlines and tweet said from CNN.",492481567591415_492550677584504

2016-02-04T20:02:45+0000,"Marlene Moore I would rather have my freedom and the Constitution than be shackled to a government that dictates my every move. The Obama government has been chipping away, at a very fast rate of speed, what the Founding Fathers fought so hard for us to have and the apathy in this country is letting them do it. And so it begins with Oregon......And Obama has much to much time to complete his mission to begger the USA. And we will never be able to arrest Obama or Congress for treason as the USA whole government is corrupt. Obama is sneaking in muslims out of Iraq AGAINST the judges orders!! They continue to incite patriotic Americans so they can force us to revolt and then they can declare martial law. Why did the DOJ go to the U.N. and ask for their help if the USA citizens get out of hand, so to speak??? Why did Kerry sign a U.N. agreement to disarm the USA?? Why do you think they have FEMA building (concentration) camps across the USA??? Why is there a huge amount of body bags and coffins being stored in Georgia?? Why has DHS bought over ONE BILLION of illegal ammo??? Why is the Bureau of Reclamation buying thousands of ammo?? Why all the military ""exercise"" taking place in states and cities and not on military land??? Why is there a shortage of survival foods on the internet as many state ""out of stock""? Better start prepping people because it will all boil over before Obama leaves office IF he leaves office. IF this is not his objective but to run for Head of the U.N. then he will have weaken our country that we will not be able to defend ourselves against his agenda of creating a One World Government. Both of these are evil options for the American Patriots to face.
If your are interested in prepping my son has started a FREE website called HOMESTEADPREPPING.COM. It has tons of information that could save you and you family's lives.

2016-02-04T03:01:24+0000,"Which of the following do you consider the more conservative course of action with taxpayer money?

1) Pay $1000 dollars in subsidies to help someone afford health insurance which covers routine and preventative care?

OR

2) Pay $10,000 dollars later when that same person needs non-routine or catastrophic care?

When a person receives routine and preventative care that person is less likely to need more extensive catastrophic care later on.

When a person is unable to afford health insurance, that person is unlikely to receive the routine and preventative care they need.  This situation typically results in that person needing more extensive, catastrophic and costly care in an emergency room.  This makes the cost of healthcare and health insurance rise exponentially for everyone each year.

A behemoth, made of media and various news outlets, who serves the financial needs of left and right-wing talking heads, and exists exclusively to keep them in power.

1) Pay $1000 dollars in subsidies to help someone afford health insurance which covers routine and preventative care?

OR

2) Pay $10,000 dollars later when that same person needs non-routine or catastrophic care?

When a person receives routine and preventative care that person is less likely to need more extensive catastrophic care later on.

When a person is unable to afford health insurance, that person is unlikely to receive the routine and preventative care they need.  This situation typically results in that person needing more extensive, catastrophic and costly care in an emergency room.

2016-02-04T00:37:00+0000,"Trump's Battle with Corrupt Media and Party Lines.....Trump is not just taking on the construct of progressive ideology that has undermined the essence of American exceptionalism; Trump is not just exposing the immense number of faux-conservatives in media and political punditry; Trump is not just allowing us to see the scope of anti-American interest; no, he’s taking on the very selfish foundation they’ve used to sell out our country.The bottom line is Donald Trump is advocating for us; he’s representing the interests of all of us who are sick and tired of being lied to and manipulated by the Mitch McConnells of the world. So while campaigning, he’s taking them head on. Donald Trump has now taken enough positions for us to clearly identify that he is indeed our friend, and as a consequence their enemy. Just look at what he has exposed in the two months since he announced. He’s done this simply by putting sunlight on issues and taking firm stances that all others in/around the same issues have apparently lied about for years. Donald Trump, a serious student of the entire decades long game, is waging a 360° war against the entire GOPe apparatus, on every single level of its construct. And yes, that also means the monolithic media empire which facilitates all of the aforementioned usurpations. In that regard, Rupert Murdoch FOX owner is part of the problem. So too Roger Ailes Fox News President is also part of the problem…. again, their interests – i.e., elect Jeb Bush- are antithetical to those of a restored, strong, free and independent U.S. Mitch McConnell, Rupert Murdoch, The RNC, Roger Ailes, Tom Donohue, Wall Street et al, are all part of the apparatus simultaneously being confronted. Trump is talking about, and, well, actually he’s doing more than talking about it, he’s taking on BIG ideological entities that have embedded themselves inside the body politic. Just like exposing the real motivation behind the RNC, or Mitch McConnell, or the NRSC in 2014’s Mississippi primary, Trump is exposing the sordid and corrupt world of the U.S. legacy media. However, better than merely exposing them, he’s taking them head-on. Trump would rather face an enemy who genuinely opposes him, MSNBC and CNN, than deal with the likes of a enemy who puts on the mask of being favorable toward him while simultaneously working diligently to eliminate him. As a consequence of the specific forethought, and after deciding it’s better to have an honest enemy, Mr. Trump is now in the position of tearing down the pillars of Roger Ailes creation. And, as evidence of Trumps’ strength therein, Roger Ailes’ responses reflect a reality that Ailes views this ENEMY, unlike any other enemy, because Trump holds Samson-like capabilities. But Trump is saying he’d rather confront an honest opponent who he knows hates him, than walk into a dishonest interview unsure of their masked ‘angle’. Donald Trump’s greatest weapon is not his money, his wealth, or his keen and astute business acumen, those are all simply tools he’s developed over a lifetime. No, his greatest weapon against these ideological foes is something we shared on the very first day of his candidacy….The American Citizen! ""Posted by Sundance""",492159780956927_492240060948899

2016-02-04T04:52:42+0000,"Sent from my iPad.    Trump vs. Cruz
Here are the facts on Trump vs. Cruz....

The fact is Cruz has been a government parasite his entire adult life, working in one government legal office or another. 

Cruz has ZERO executive experience! 

Cruz is two years into his first term as Texas' junior senator, nearly all of which he has spent running for president, neglecting his duties to the people of Texas.

Cruz's 2016 resume is nearly identical to Barack Hussein's 2008 resume. How has that worked out for you? 

Cruz has a horrible attendance record at senate roll calls. 

Cruz has spent the past two years pissing off nearly everyone in Washington, including most Republicans.

Cruz’s time in the senate thus far has been marked by failure. Bitching about Democrats is NOT an accomplishment.

To Cruz's credit, he has tried on several occasions to stop Democrat legislation. He failed miserably EACH AND EVERY TIME! Do you really want an habitual failure as president? Really? Like I said, bitching is not an accomplishment.

I am getting a little queasy with the term ""conservative"" these days. It doesn't really define anything. It tends to be clung to by the extreme right and those who believe their president should be a very religious man. Nonsense! I don't personally care about a president's religion, or lack thereof. I care that he is a stone cold patriot! I believe very much in the separation of church and state. If you want to live in a theocracy, move to Iran!

Cruz has had his hand out his entire adult life, enjoying his government paycheck, never having to take responsibility for anything. 

Cruz's support begins and ends with the Tea Party, and there it will die. Outside the Tea Party, Cruz is a virtual nobody.

Now juxtapose Cruz's record with Donald Trump's.

Trump is a multibazillionaire for a reason. He KNOWS how to build prosperity. It oozes from his pores. Wouldn't you like a more free and prosperous future for yourself, your children, and grandchildren?

Trump is a self-made man. He commands a humongous company with tens of thousands of employees.

This is EXTREMELY important! Trump has had a lifetime of P&L executive leadership. P&L is where the rubber meets the road!

Trump is a patriot! Some say in their whiney voices, ""But, but, but Trump is not a conservative."" Only a certified moron would say that! Look at Trump's platform. As stated, I get a little queasy with the term ""conservative"" these days. However, if Trump isn't a conservative, then neither is border security, a balanced budget, trade reform, a strong military, putting the screws on Iran, obliterating ISIS, trade reform, repealing Obamacare, etc., etc., etc. 

I could go on and on. Bottom line - Trump is a lifelong, experienced winner! Cruz is a government parasite loser with no executive experience whatsoever!",492183480954557_492303777609194

2016-02-04T03:02:33+0000,"Which of the following do you consider the more conservative course of action with taxpayer money?

1) Pay $1000 dollars in subsidies to help someone afford health insurance which covers routine and preventative care?

OR

2) Pay $10,000 dollars later when that same person needs non-routine or catastrophic care?

When a person receives routine and preventative care that person is less likely to need more extensive catastrophic care later on.

When a person is unable to afford health insurance, that person is unlikely to receive the routine and preventative care they need.  This situation typically results in that person needing more extensive, catastrophic and costly care in an emergency room.  This makes the cost of healthcare and health insurance rise exponentially for everyone each year.

2016-02-03T22:18:56+0000,"I have been giving serious and thoughtful consideration to what America gets in a Donald Trump presidency. Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it. It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great. He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump. No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with a half brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally. Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people. He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",492130654293173_492217280951177

Donald Trump makes a face as he and his wife Melania and members of their family leave the stage at his caucus night rally in Des Moines, Iowa Reuters
Monday was not a good day for Donald Trump. His infamous phrase ‘loser’ came back to haunt him when he was forced to admit defeat to rival Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucus after weeks of being billed as the Republican frontrunner. 

But on Tuesday, it emerged that Trump’s name had reportedly made it on to a list of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize - alongside figures such as Pope Francis and a campaigner for Isis rape survivors.

Iowa caucus: Donald Trump mercilessly mocked after defeat
Trump’s reported nomination comes after he made a number of inflammatory and divisive comments in the run-up to the caucus. The billionaire business magnate ""endeared himself to millions by proposing Muslims be banned from entering the US and has been condemned for his comments about immigration and Mexican migrants, with one of his most infamous pledges being to build a “big beautiful wall” between the US and Mexico.",492130654293173_492218367617735

2016-02-03T19:36:51+0000,"I have been giving serious and thoughtful consideration to what America gets in a Donald Trump presidency. Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it. It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great. He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump. No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with a half brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally. Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people. He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",492129240959981_492189410953964

In other words became a lot more impoverished from budget cuts and downsizing of state and federal government. Few seem to recognize that our own government caused the downfall of the economy. It is the only singular entity capable of doing so. The government can fortify the economy or destroy it by spending wisely within the nation and providing salaries or hoarding wealth and freezing wages, doing away with Jobs. Just remember every dollar taken out of a budget is also being removed from the economy. Theoretically it even prevents more money from being made by those who other wise would have earned it. Sensibility is in better spending not less spending in the US. If your candidate is talking savings in budget cuts they cant even see how to fortifiy the dollar. Other than having a budget the concept is not the same as personal accounts, every dollar available must be spent to strengthen the nation. As a nation power is not in the banks safe its in using that wealth to create production and availability of resources within the United States.",492126600960245_492183857621186

Yes, you read that correctly.

The person nominating him has not been identified as of yet, but the reason for his nomination has been…

According Kristian Berg Harpviken, via the Independent, he is nominated for “his vigorous peace through strength ideology, used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical Islam, Isis, nuclear Iran and Communist China.”

Is this a serious nomination? If it is for real, will it be taken seriously by the committee? I have no idea right now, but I really hope it is.

How ironic would it be that Obama won his Nobel for something he promised to do and never delivered and Trump would win his for cleaning up Obama’s mess!",492124707627101_492166367622935

All the cheaters showed their true colors in Iowa. And it's not Red, white, and blue.

Look up how Russia got the uranium mine up north, then sold said uranium to Iran.....

All politicians know about it...... Look up agenda 21... Selling USA lands to foreign countries. ....

No more career politicians....
Look up new world order, Canada, Mexico, and USA becoming one country.... Goodbye ole USA...

Be careful what you vote for.....

Look up black plaque in Colorado, Cruz says no deporting, Rubio says amnesty...

These career politicians care nothing about our safety. If they did they would secure the borders.... Money, power, greed, and votes...

I watched a special on tv last night about Canada's water oil pollution and its plants....
Look up how many people are dying from pollution in Canada.. Kinda sounds like flint..

Look up the Mexico Isis camp 8/10 miles inside Mexico border....

Look up fema trains, fema camps, Sam waltons/Walmart dream.....

Look up human chips suppose to be mandatory starting in 2017......

Look up social security cost starting in 2017, you will loose 4200.00 a year...

Look up how the government borrows from social security and hasn't paid it back.....

Look up empty walmarts with tunnels under them.....

   What he did to Carson is sick , nothing moral or spiritual there, proves he is a sewer rat.
Rubio will open the borders like Clinton will, and let the illegals flow in this country!

Trump must have huge ground games in the states needed...

We need Trump

Trump proved how deep his support is  , Trump won 7 delegates ..Ted got 8 .. That's only 1 less and Trump spent very little money in Iowa , Ted spent Millions for one extra , I take that as a win for Trump.
Trump doesn't need Iowa , he even said he would like to win it , but he is polling double digits in every other state.
He's already the winner!

  Now the trains rolling through NH  , go ahead and gloat Ted over your 1 extra delegate, that's the last win for you!
Iowa hasn't picked a winner in 16 years , just proved to America they just can't pick a winner ever!

I KNOW  America needs a strong leader in which Donald Trump has proven to be a Phenomenal Leader ! He is an Astute Businessman which is Exactly what America needs to navigate our country into the right direction for a prosperous future ! Donald J. Trump is that man ! Iowa doesn't tell the story of who wins the Presidential Election!!! On to New Hampshire and let the race begin !!!!
Iowa was the awakening for the conservative movement. It's an extension of 2014. You need to look at the turnout, a massive record shattering turnout for the Republicans. The Democrats... well... they had less than 2008. America is fired up, pissed, angry, and yesterday, in one state, we saw 1/50 states show how angry they are at this Congress and President.!!! 
Donald Trump has built an uncompromising campaign organization over the last decades. 
It's called delegation by Donald Trump. It is admirable.
It's connected, thorough, responsible, and responsive. 
This is also why he will win.!!!!! 
I heard that there was complete disorganization and that 100,000 people were turned away from voting because they ran out of cards .. and then this morning the Carson campaign accused Cruz of fraudulently obtaining votes by telling voters that Carson was dropping out --so vote instead for (the other evangelical choice) Ted Cruz. Reagan didn't win Iowa and went on to win the Primary and Election and I believe the same will happen with Donald Trump!!!!!!!!!!!

Americans all over the country are fed up with muslim terrorists and democratic liberal crybabies hurting our country and its citizens. 
Please start the ball rolling towards us bringing America back to the top again.
We must have a president that loves this country and puts the safety of all citizens 1st and foremost. 
A president that will close our borders to illegals and welcome legals.
Make smarter trade deals on inports and exports. 
Bring needed jobs back to America , strengthen our military and take care of the most loyal of citizens!    OUR VETS.
We need a strong , energetic president with savvy business smarts to strengthen our economy and yes by all means build that wall.
I could go on and on , but I believe the greatest thing any new president can do is to please put GOD back into AMERICA and he will be a great leader.

A whole lotta people cryin' ""Don't blame me""
They point their crooked little fingers ar everybody else
Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your momma's too thin; your daddy's too fat

Get over it
Get over it
All this whinin' and cryin' and pitchin' a fit
Get over it, get over it

You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing

Get over it
Get over it
If you don't want to play, then you might as well split
Get over it, Get over it

It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
You're makin' the most of your losin' streak
Some call it sick, but I call it weak

You drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt; you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter, bringin' everybody down
Complain about the present and blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass

Get over it
Get over it
All this bitchin' and moanin' and pitchin' a fit
Get over it, get over it

Get over it
Get over it
It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit
Get over it, get over itTrump!! Trump!!!! Trump !!! 2016

Americans all over the country are fed up with muslim terrorists and democratic liberal crybabies hurting our country and its citizens. 
Please start the ball rolling towards us bringing America back to the top again.
We must have a president that loves this country and puts the safety of all citizens 1st and foremost. 
A president that will close our borders to illegals and welcome legals.
Make smarter trade deals on inports and exports. 
Bring needed jobs back to America , strengthen our military and take care of the most loyal of citizens!    OUR VETS.
We need a strong , energetic president with savvy business smarts to strengthen our economy and yes by all means build that wall.
I could go on and on , but I believe the greatest thing any new president can do is to please put GOD back into AMERICA and he will be a great leader.

‘In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person’s becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American…There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn’t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag… We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.. And we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.’

Tell the truth, we already have socialism in medicine. What does the public think Medicaid is?  Medicare is also socialism.  The working class paid for it.  Private insurance is spreading propaganda because they have a huge business that has everything to do with profits and the public needs to wake up.  We deserve good care and BCBS, UHC, Aetna, Cigna  being one of the worst does not provide it. How many have it and when you or a family member need it, is told that your needs are not medically necessary?  All this, After the huge premiums you pay. That is private sector insurance for you.

"" like with a cloth or something"" what most people don't realize 
because they are too stupid is that smart ass answers like that 
are nothing more than a stall tactic unless you are really stupid 
enough to believe he was asking if you wiped it clean with a 
cloth you also went on to say you knew nothing about the digital 
world if that is true you had no business what so ever having 
your own private server with classified documents on you were either 
negligent which means you are too stupid to do anything other than 
lick windows and federal charges should be filed for negligence the 
alternative is you are not that stupid and you should be charged 
with treason instead of negligence so your choices are you are 
either a retarded bitch that should go to prison for the rest 
of your life for being retarded or you are a treasonous bitch 
and if that is the case the government should be nice and 
let you choose your sentence hanging or firing squad

     ---XLR8---

As Secretary of State it is Hillary Clinton's job to deal with top secret 
information all the time so she either had top secret information on the 
private server in which case she should be charged with treason. or she 
is incompetent and did not do her job if it is a case that she did not 
do her job then she should never hold public office again and the person 
that gave her that job should go to jail so Hillary please tell 
us are you too incompetent to hold a job or are you a liar and a traitor

to why did your husband outsource your bedroom duties

Subj: interesting take on Trump

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",490512397788332_490564927783079

We NEED Leadership and Strength for President... MR TRUMP is time-tested, A Leader by action, by example, a successful world executive. He is bold, unique, and strong with his convictions...Not afraid to tell it like it is. Trump is a brilliant man... He knows not to suck-up on Trump Haters gotcha cheap games ( like Fox - Megan Kelly recent Presidential debate)- Fox and Kelly are just another snakes in the grass... Trump is as big as our fears and as strong as our adversaries. 

Trump did not bring America in the major crisis we are in now and in a nearing 20Trillion national debt. 

The young generation Americans who are able to vote now just better Smart Up and Wake Up! This will impact a great deal of your livelihood in years to come.... Ask yourself: Do you really want to vote for the same Spineless, Lying politicians/ Rinos that are controlled by establishment, donors, GOP operatives who will say what you want to hear but turn around and do something else.....  

Trump is not controlled & not a puppet by establishment. I support Trump stances, Together, WE will ""Make America Great Again""👍🏼🇺🇸

If you look at the picture in the lead in post you will see the latch part on the door.
 4 inch screws in the door jamb which is a good thing to do to strengthen the latch plate will not keep the door knob latch or lock latch from splintering the flimsy door panel of a wooden or fiberglass door.
Along with longer screws in door striker plates you need reinforcement plate around the door knob and latch.

And a better door jamb striker plate.

Reason I say this is I went through the exact same thing but my ex (12 yr old sons father) ended up along his phone which I bought and pay for... I gave since his father has a tendency to abuse him while in his care.   He tried to take my sons phone so he couldn't call me.

It helps to know this bit of information, please share , this was written by Robert Snowden...TRUMP IS BRILLIANT!! On Trump boycotting the Fox News debate: If you think this struggle is just between Trump and Megan Kelly, you are more than naive. Trump is raising a MEGA-Movement, a counter-revolution, by standing against the Globalist Elite that own both the Republican and Democrat Parties, and own the Media that own all the Spin Doctors like NeoCon Review's gang of 22, Charles Krauthammer, and Megyn Kelly. He is standing against the establishment that controls the six corporations that own the T.V. and radio media, all of the major news papers, most of the small so-called independent papers, and the 99 percent of the publishing houses. These are the people that also own and control the Federal Reserve and all the Western Central Banks that have held our economy hostage to their New World Order Agenda, robbed us of Constitutional Governance, and relegated our children and Grand Children to debt slavery in a quasi-Marxist Poverty State. This ELECTION is between Donald Trump and the Globalist Criminals that control every aspect of our Government, every NGO that is pushing a Globalist agenda - from the Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros, UNESCO, USAID, and the Clinton Foundation. Simply put, this is the most important election in our life time. (Donald Trump President 2016)",490027967836775_490146107824961

2016-01-29T04:41:19+0000,"TRUMP IS BRILLIANT!! If you think this struggle is just between Trump and Megan Kelly, you are more than naive. Trump is raising a MEGA-Movement, a counter-revolution, by standing against the Globalist Elite that own both the Republican and Democrat Parties, and own the Media that own all the Spin Doctors like NeoCon Review’s gang of 22, Charles Krauthammer, and Megyn Kelly.

He is standing against the establishment that controls the six corporations that own the T.V. and radio media, all of the major news papers, most of the small so-called independent papers, and the 99 percent of the publishing houses. These are the people that also own and control the Federal Reserve and all the Western Central Banks that have held our economy hostage to their New World Order Agenda, robbed us of Constitutional Governance, and relegated our children and Grand Children to debt slavery in a quasi-Marxist Poverty State.

This ELECTION is between Donald Trump and the Globalist Criminals that control every aspect of our Government, every NGO that is pushing a Globalist agenda – from the Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros, UNESCO, USAID, and the Clinton Foundation. Simply put, this is the most important election in our life time. (Donald Trump President 2016)",489974654508773_490254134480825

Trump knows this and a reporter has exposed one of Washington’s best kept secrets, namely Fox’s role via its founder Rupert Murdoch in pushing an open borders agenda. The Trump campaign is a direct threat to Murdoch’s efforts to open America’s borders. Hidden from virtually all reporting on Fox’s treatment of Trump is the fact that Murdoch is the co-chair of the most powerful immigration lobbying firms for illegal aliens in America, the Partnership for a new American Economy!

It helps to know this bit of information, please share , this was written by Robert Snowden...TRUMP IS BRILLIANT!! On Trump boycotting the Fox News debate: If you think this struggle is just between Trump and Megan Kelly, you are more than naive. Trump is raising a MEGA-Movement, a counter-revolution, by standing against the Globalist Elite that own both the Republican and Democrat Parties, and own the Media that own all the Spin Doctors like NeoCon Review's gang of 22, Charles Krauthammer, and Megyn Kelly. He is standing against the establishment that controls the six corporations that own the T.V. and radio media, all of the major news papers, most of the small so-called independent papers, and the 99 percent of the publishing houses. These are the people that also own and control the Federal Reserve and all the Western Central Banks that have held our economy hostage to their New World Order Agenda, robbed us of Constitutional Governance, and relegated our children and Grand Children to debt slavery in a quasi-Marxist Poverty State. This ELECTION is between Donald Trump and the Globalist Criminals that control every aspect of our Government, every NGO that is pushing a Globalist agenda - from the Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros, UNESCO, USAID, and the Clinton Foundation. Simply put, this is the most important election in our life time. (Donald Trump President 2016)",489974311175474_490046614501577

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",489954974510741_489989751173930

The News Media and politicians are suppose to work for and represent the people ....I am Not watching the debate without Trump participating... Why you ask?... We voted in Career Politicians in the last two elections (like Ted Cruz) that did nothing to stop the destruction of our country! Career Politicians Work for their BIG Donors... Donald Trump WILL Work For Us... We the People...

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",489628494543389_489660547873517

“We have a presidential candidate whose loudest message reeks of hatred and Islamophobia… turning on the news now is scary, and oftentimes, humiliating,” the Muslim woman, Nabela Noor, says in a December YouTube video.

She admits to becoming a Muslim political activist amid the growing criticism of Islam’s doctrines. “The current social environment for Muslims today is not safe or just… as a Muslim American, I felt like I needed to use my voice,” she claimed. 

Noor also urged her YouTube viewers to rally against critics of Islam. “I’m so thankful for those who speak up and out against anti-Islamic speech and ideologies. Our community needs more allies like you, but we have a long way to go,” she said.

This is an interesting assessment of ""The Donald.""  This person may have nailed this guy for what he really is.

Trump Is Not Conservative, He’s A Pragmatist
By Mychal Massie on January 19, 2016 in Daily Rant, Race & Politics 5

We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.

I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative. I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.

Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.

Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and well being, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff – appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow. In brief, it has brought liberal ideology with a pachyderm as a mascot juxtaposed to the ass of the Democrat Party.

Immigration isn’t a Republican problem – it isn’t a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.

The impending collapse of the economy isn’t a liberal or conservative problem it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.

Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn’t work you don’t continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.

As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn’t made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through a Carl’s Hamburgers.

I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.

You may not like Donald Trump but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: 1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; 2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; 3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and 4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.

Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts that people don’t give tens of millions without expecting something in return.

We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worst off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties?

I submit that a pragmatist might be just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done.

People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance but that is common amongst those who have never accomplished anything in their lives and who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.",489623837877188_489637231209182

None of my media colleagues have brought out the TRUTH of what is really happening and I would love to hear anyone's take on this. Let's go to reality, Megyn Kelly is NOT FOX NEWS, she does not OWN that show, she does not buy time for the show, she is an employee of FOX. Since the first debate AND NO ONE HAS BROUGHT THIS UP BUT ME BECAUSE NO ONE GETS IT OR EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA IS AFRAID TO SPEAK THE TRUTH. We all know the establishment has had it in for Trump, you have these PAC's for Ted, Jeb Marco and the rest WASTING MILLIONS of dollars daily on attacks on Trump. And who is the money in these PAC's, they are big business and who is big business??? SPONSORS, SPONSORS OF NETWORKS LIKE FOX. How do Networks keep their lights on? How do they pay salaries? Yes, SPONSORS, AD SALES. Now you have some BIG sponsors who mean Millions in revenue for your network year after year and they are with these PAC's and BIG MONEY boys who don't want to see Trump succeed, so what happens? ""Well if you don't move things away from Trump and more towards the established politicians than we may have to take our ad dollars elsewhere!"" It's a big game. It was OBVIOUS in the first debate. Megyn Kelly did not have a PERSONAL vendetta against Trump, remember she is working for a PAYCHECK, she is working for a NETWORK, they control their people. Did Donald get questions like, ""Mr. Trump we are Trillions of dollars in debt, we are losing jobs to the Orient, what would you do as POTUS?"" NO instead ""you call women fat pigs!"" COME ON PEOPLE WAKE UP this is not about Megyn Kelly it is about FOX and the pressure of the ADVERTISERS!!! Trump is not intimidated by a reporter, Trump is not scared, of course that is what Jeb, Marco and Ted will be saying at the debate, ""well if Trump can't handle Megyn Kelly how is he going to handle Putin!"" Trust me, in my years in the media and following Mr. Trump's success he has handled a lot tougher people than Megyn Kelly. But again, remember it is not her! Do you think it is by design that they are having people on like Michael Moore?? Give me a break it's about MONEY people. Well my only hope is that the debate does not get an audience, because we don't need people tuning in to see what the others are saying about Donald. I think the idea of Donald doing a ""counter"" program for the Vets is genius!

2016-01-27T07:24:14+0000,"(PLEASE SHARE or COPY & PASTE) My Top Ten Reasons To Support and Vote for Trump:
1. Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump’s without being able to win at the negotiating table.
3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.
10. Donald Trump loves this country – and says so. He wants to make America great again🇺🇸. 
AND
Big Bad & Bold 
Unafraid To Speak The Truth 
This Man is No Government Puppet 
The Only Man To Really Bring Back America 
A Man To Stop The Stalemate in Washington 
The Right Man To Bring Back A Wealthy America So All People Can Feel Good About The Direction This County is Headed.

2016-01-27T21:05:51+0000,Ted Cruz has not said anything about cleaning up Congress or the Senate and getting rid of all the old time dying politicians who live everyday the same way on the American dime. During his time in office he hasn't done very much so do you really expect that he would do more. He can't get along with his fellow diplomats do you think that he can get along with foreign powers. I have never seen anybody turn two faced as fast as he did over the last few days. Famous last words no I'm not going to fight with Trump. And now he's calling him out. Trump doesn't want to get his hands dirty with such trash. Trump is more interested in taking care of things in America such as our veterans.,489313784574860_489696104536628

2016-01-26T21:12:46+0000,"I have been giving serious and thoughtful consideration to what America gets in a Donald Trump presidency. Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it. It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great. He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump. No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with a half brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally. Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people. He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",489294547910117_489368351236070

He says he would rather have destroyed the gun in his evidence room instead. 
He never once rebutted the fact that the background system is broken and he also said that he wasn't talking about it to begin with. 
But why? What was the entire point of him speaking at all? He got nothing accomplished by doing that and in fact the only thing he said with certainty was that he was a police chief for 10 years. 
By his very vague dialogue he seemed to infer that he'd rather destroy guns and make law enforcement the only means of protection.

I endured a lot of hardships and problems.  I do not expect anything to be given me. I have always paid my way! I got through college and graduated with the highest grade point in my nursing class. I worked a salary job and got paid for 40 hours, even though I put in 70-90 hours almost every week, because my patients were important to me, and I felt they deserved the extra time I spent on them. I was a hospice nurse, and I felt it was a privilege to be accepted in the last days. Weeks, and even years in a few of them. I went in beautiful estates and meager shacks, but I treated them all the same. God was with me, and I got more from my work with them than they did.  I want to see you win this election so badly. I believe that you are the man for the job. I really do! You have the guts to stand up for what is right. You are a good man. Please keep working for this position.

2016-01-26T04:53:01+0000,"Trump is a true Conservative. First before i describe how you can tell true conservatives such as amish, Trump, Trump Supporters. from the phony conservatives and phony republicans such as the gutless pansy Glenn beck and the dishonorable gutless scum of the national review who i personally challenge and call them out along with their buddies the establishment rippofficans. face to face to me and attack and insult and threaten me to my face for supporting trump if you have the balls. Fact nonody but Amish is born true conservatives, nobody. we all have the veil of deception covering our eyes as we go through life, make mistakes, and learn and grow till something happens to remove that veil of deception and from that point on we become conservative. Me it was when i found out it was the liberal progressives NOT the evangelicals and conservatives behind the censorship group the PMRC who tried to destroy metal music. You may say why them attacking metal bands when they were living and promoting and singing about alot of the immoral lifestyle choices liberal progressives push and promote to day and try to use the lie of they were born that way. Well Let me first explain to you the motto of the liberal progressives , the entire left wing as well as the establishment rippofficans and these phony conservatives like glenn beck and nation review assclowns.  Their motto is  ""If we can not enslave, manipulate and control them, then we must destroy them"" They couldnt enslave, manipulate or control metal bands so they tried to destroy them with this censorship crap. Just like they are doing today with the modern version of censorship called political correctness.  Here is how you tell a true conservative.  1. we never retreat, 2. We never surrender 3. we never backdown 4. we always take  10 steps forward no steps back 5. we take no prisoners and take no crap 6. we live by the motto death before dishonor 7. we make our enemies extinct, we never appease,sympathize with the enemy. 8. we show no mercy and those who attack us we go for the jugular and put our boot to their throat till they submit. 9. our will can never be broken. 10. the most important one. WE NEVER COMPROMISE. whether it's our morals, values, judea christian beliefs, god given freedoms, honor, dignity. For absolutely any reason.  Because compromising is for losers, cowards and those with no honor.  There is an ancient warriors code of honor that states. those who compromise especially the things i mentioned above for any reason they have no honor and a person with no honor can never lead nor should they ever be trusted. That's a true conservative also a true conservative has the balls to speak the brutal truth whether society wants to here it or is offended by it. and a true conservative can never be bought. and that describes trump. Those who attack him fear him because of the truth he speaks because to them the truth is like sunlight to a vampire. Trump and we true conservatives will take our part back which is the GOP republican party then we wil take our country back From the enemies within this nation which is the establishment rippofficans, their buddies the phony conservatives glenn beck and national review, and the islamic communist traitorous liberal progressives and entire left wing. as for Glenn Beck and national review assclowns they need to join their retarded cowardice dishonorable lying buddy who also lives in the land of make believe Jessie the jackass ventura and start their own conspiracy bull crap show on Art Bells radio program and go fade back into obscurity where they belong. and let a True leader Trump Save this nation.

2016-01-26T02:05:19+0000,"I have been giving serious and thoughtful consideration to what America gets in a Donald Trump presidency. Foremost, America gets a man of his word. Think about it.  It has now been about 6 months since Trump announced his quest for the Republican nomination. He has made statements of position on several issues, got immediate flack and has yet to back down. His love of this nation is too great.  He’s in it too far to weaken, waver or capitulate. Donald Trump is in it to win.

His strong suit is his negotiating skills to make deals which can make America great. He is a brash patriot, an old line politician’s nightmare, a son of capitalism, a fresh approach to decades of problems, a soul of hidden compassion, a bearer of basic truths and a winner. His thought process is so far advanced beyond the average person‘s, that he is astonished when opposition, real or politically manufactured, pops up. He is already on the next third of fourth page. Trump’s IQ borders on genius and we average Americans have trouble grasping that.

It would seem that old line (the establishment) politicians  of both parties would welcome an opportunity to play a positive role in dealing with this man on behalf of making this Nation a better, fairer, safer, and more unique one. If they don’t, they can count on being justifiably and rudely called out by Trump.  No other candidate of either party can offer anything positive toward moving the country in the plus category. All they offer is a promise of more gridlock. Crash and burn, destroy …. more gridlock. 

It is obvious to anyone with a half brain, this country cannot continue the death spiral it has seen for the past two presidential cycles. America cannot survive its current deterioration… politically, socially, economically, militarily and culturally.  Donald Trump will not reverse this deadly national trend solely by his effort, but he can be the critical catalyst and driving power that gets the ball rolling. He owes no favors to anyone other than the American people.  He may well be the last great hope to not only help America to survive, but to make America great again.",489044914601747_489091837930388

2016-01-25T20:03:32+0000,"Jihad. It was once a word unfamiliar to American ears. But in recent years it has become all too familiar. The actions of Muslim militants and terrorists have seared the word into American consciousness.
Yet even with thousands of innocent civilians killed on American soil by Islamic terrorists, the full significance of the Muslim concept of jihad has not been grasped by the American public.
In the days after September 11, 2001, American leaders rushed to portray Islam as a peaceful religion that had been ""hijacked"" by a fanatical band of terrorists. One hopes that these assurances were merely tactical—that nobody was meant to believe them and that they were meant to assure the Muslim world that the inevitable American reprisals were not directed at their religion as a whole. 
If the world Muslim community perceived America as attacking Islam in general then the duty of every Muslim to fight for his religion—the duty of jihad—would have been invoked on a broad scale. The war against terrorism, instead of simmering with occasional flare-ups, like the Cold War, would have boiled over into a global conflagration, with the Muslim countries of the world—1.2 billion strong—mobilizing against America and the West.
Muslim apologists also rushed forward to assure the public that Islam was a peaceful religion. They disingenuously declared that the word Islam means ""peace."" And they tried to portray the terrorists as a fringe group outside the mainstream of Islam.

These were lies.

The usual meaning of Islam in Arabic is not ""peace"" but ""submission."" And if the terrorists were so far outside the mainstream, why did Muslims all over the world burst into joyful, spontaneous celebrations when the hijacked jetliners slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon? Why are Islamic governments afraid to show ""too much"" public support for the war against terrorism? Further, why are all the governments that covertly support terrorism centered in the Muslim world?
We will never coexist, it's either them or us.",488964281276477_489023807937191

Looking back over his interviews and speeches, it appears that Trump came into the race with only a vague idea -- or perhaps no idea -- how he wanted to handle some major, obvious, policy issues. So, when someone pointed out a new wrinkle that Trump hadn't thought of, he came up with a new answer. And then another.

On some issues, Trump's campaign has gone through more than half a dozen plans in two months. And counting. For instance:

Donald Trump’s plan to defeat the Islamic State.

Version #1: Find a guy.

“Within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that’s going to take that military, and make it really work. ” (June 16, presidential campaign kickoff speech)

Version #2: [Secret plan]

Bill O’Reilly, Fox News Channel: “Are you telling me you are going to send American ground troops into Syria?”

Trump: “I'm not telling you anything.” (June 16)

Version #3: No longer secret. Send in American ground troops.

“I will tell you what my plan will be…. You have to go in. You have to go in.”

O’Reilly: “With ground troops?”

“Well, you bomb the hell out of them and then you encircle it, and then you go in.” (June 16, shortly after Version #2).

Version #4: Maybe don’t.

O’Reilly: “There's no way you can defeat them without invading.”

Trump: “I disagree.” (June 16, minutes after #3).

Version #5: Definitely do send in ground troops. Have them seize ISIS oilfields.

“We’re going to have so much money.” (Sunday, NBC's Meet the Press).

Version #6: Send in ground troops. Seize oilfields. Sell the oil, and give the money to the families of the soldiers who died protecting the oil.

“What I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers that were killed, the soldiers, the wounded warriors that are -- see, I love them….” (Sunday, NBC's Meet the Press).

Version #7: Send in ground troops. Seize oilfields. Sell the oil. Give some of the money to the families of the soldiers who died protecting the oil.

Chuck Todd, NBC: “Shouldn't [oil money] be given to the Iraqis?

Trump: “Well, we can give them something.” (Sunday, seconds after #7)

Now, Donald Trump’s plan for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.

Version #1: Figure it out later.

“The first thing we have to do is strengthen our borders. And after that, we're going to have plenty of time to talk about it.” (July 23)

Version #2: Figure it out now. Deport “the bad ones.” Work out something so the good ones can stay.

“If somebody's been outstanding, we try and work something out.” (July 24)

Version #3: Deport the bad ones. Maybe let some of the good ones stay.

“We're going to do what's right. Some are going to have to go. And some, we're just going to see what happens.” (July 26)

Version #4: Deport everybody.

“But the good ones -- of which there are many -- I want to expedite it so they can come back in legally.” (July 27)

Version #5: Maybe don’t deport everybody.

Dana Bash, CNN: “What about the ‘Dreamers?’ What about people who came here when they were children, they didn't know what they were doing, they came with their parents who brought them here illegally?... Should they have to leave, too?

Trump: “They're with their parents? It depends.” (July 29)

Version #6: Deport everybody, the sequel.

Chuck Todd, NBC: [talking about the “Dreamers”] “You're going to kick them out?”

Trump: “They have to go.” (Sunday, on “Meet the Press.”)

Then there's Donald Trump’s plan for tax reform.

Version #1: Make taxes simpler.

“Simplify it. At a minimum, simplify it.” (June 18)

Version #2: Don't have a plan.

""You can't be just boom, boom, hard and fast."" (August 11, in an interview on CNN).

Version #3: Maybe get rid of the income tax and have a national consumption tax, which proponents call a “Fair Tax.”

“You can have a ‘Fair Tax…’ (August 11, just after #2).

Version #4: Or maybe keep the income tax, but make it one flat rate for everybody.

“You can have a flat tax….” (August 11, just after #3).

Version #5: Or maybe don’t change the current system at all. Except add new things. Which will be really good.

“Or you can leave the system alone, which is probably the simplest at this point. Leave the system alone and take out deductions and lower taxes and do lots of really good things, leaving the system the way it is.” (August 11, just after #4)

Version #6: [Secret plan]

“I know exactly what I want to do, I just don't want to announce it yet.” (August 11, just after #2, #3, #4 and #5).

Version #6a: [Definitely secret]

Chris Cuomo, CNN: “If I was sitting across from you, making you a pitch to do anything for you and I said, ‘Look, I got a plan, but I'm not going to tell you yet.’ I think I'd get an eye roll and I'd get ushered out of the office.”

Trump: “Oh, I'm going to say it. I'm just not prepared to tell you right now on your fantastic show that is getting better ratings all the time because you have Trump on so much.” (same interview)

And Donald Trump’s plan for the nuclear deal with Iran.

Version #1: Renegotiate it.

“I guarantee you that if I were president, this deal wouldn't be made, a deal would be made that's 100 times better.” (August 11)

Version #2: Maybe don’t renegotiate it.

“It’s very tough to do, when you say, ‘Rip up a deal.’ Because I’m a deal person…. I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance.”

Chuck Todd, NBC: “So the deal lives, in a Trump administration?”

Trump: “It's very hard to say, ‘We're ripping up.’” (Sunday, Meet the Press).

Here's Donald Trump’s plan for “Obamacare.”

Version #1: Get rid of it. Replace it with something ""much better.""

“Let it be for everybody. But much better, and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it."" (June 16, presidential campaign announcement.)

Version #2: Get rid of it. Replace it with something ""terrific,"" which lets people buy insurance across state lines. And still gives poor people a way to get health care, when they can’t pay for it.

“I want to take care of everybody. You know, you have a group of people that aren't able to take care of themselves.""

Dana Bash, CNN: “How do you do that?” (July 29)

Version #3: Work out “some kind of a deal” with hospitals.

""We're going to have work out some kind of deal with hospitals where they can get some help, when they are sick, when they have no money and they are sick....""

Bash: “How do you do that, though?” (July 29, just after #2)

Version #4: The deal will be very, very smart.

Trump: “We are going to have to work out some kind of a very, very smart deal with hospitals around the country.” (July 29, just after #3).

And finally: Donald Trump’s plan for governing the United States.

Version #1: Be flexible.

“We’ve had no leadership in the country…. For doing that, you need compromise. You need back-and-forth. And it’s not about a plan. It’s about flexibility. You need flexibility.” (Aug. 14)",487988261374079_488109518028620

Well people here is a major issue with Ted Cruz 
Mr Cruz states on TV that Trump braces the republican rhinos starting to back him and states he is part of the regular Republican Party now, and Ted Cruz says he will not work with any of them he calls all of them in house and senate the problem what is Ted Cruz going to do be like Obama and use executive orders to run this country ??? 

Is this what we really want in this country someone in office Ted Cruz that runs the White House like a dictatorship just like Obama is doing?

Someone has to be able to make good fair deal with both sides of the party right. One side controls the money / purse strings as they say and not issuing money for anything my god.
Trump can work real deals tackle real issues in this country I don't see Ted Cruse being part of the cure for what is going on in the country I see him causing a major tornado that will cause major distraction for the country in way only Obama could be used as an example .
Trump will be the man to work our security make our homeland 100% safe.
Trump will handle people crossing our boarders and people allowed to enter with poor screening.
Trump will handle getting company's back to the United States putting American jobs first above outsiders taking our company's overseas.
Trump can and will work with democrats and republicans to get done what need to be done.
Trump has the skills and mindset to deal with overseas company's and governments.
Vote Trump give our country a fighting chance to win for once in our life .
I vote Trump to send our men and woman into combat if need be and be there commander and chief 
To be there for our troops when they come home and take care of them.",487963981376507_488079384698300

2016-01-23T02:42:30+0000,"those morons who attack trump are not nore ever was true conservatives. they wouldnt know what true conservatives wasif donald trump and those of us who support him tapped danced on their heads with steel toed boots.  Fact is these clowns attacking trump still have the biblical described veil of deception covering their eyes. this is for them here is  how you can tell what true conservatives like us is.  1. True conservatives never give up. 2. true conservatives never retreat 3. true conservatives never surrender. 4. true conservatives never back down. 5. true conservativess take no prisoners and take no crap 6. true republicans never takes a step backward only ten steps forward. 7. true conservatives go through our enemies like crap through a goose 8. The most important one of all  is true conservatives Never Compromise.  Old ancient warrior code saying that a person who compromises has no honor and those who have no honor can never lead nor should they ever be trusted.  Those attack trump and bring up his past liberal stances. Guess what you morons of National Review you phony conservatives. NOBODY IS BORN CONSERVATIVE unless your a Amish. But most people grow up learn and grow and remove the veil of deception from their eyes to become conservaitve. me it was when i find out when it was the liberal progressives who were behind and created the first censorship group thing the PMRC. and they were behind trying to destroy metal music . Some of you may say why most of those bands were singing and promoting immoral liberal progressive lifestyles but i will explain it this way the liberal progressives and the entire left as well as the establishment rippofficans and these phony conservatives of national review all have a motto. if it cant be enslaved, manipulated or controlled then it must be destroyed. Metal couldnt be controlled or manipulated so the left tried to destroy it. then came along a genre of musicans they could manipulate and control because they were the whiny entitlement cutlure which the genre is known as grunge.  You see these groups like these phony conservatives, establishment rippofficans and islamic communist traitorous liberal progressives  all go by if they can not enslave it, manipulate and control it then they must destroy it.  Trump unlike the rest can  not be bought and they fear that. they fear the brutal truth he speaks because to them the truth is like sunlight to vampires. I personally like to pull the pull the punk card or punk out or call out and challenge these 22 phony conservative clowns to debate me face to face if they got the balls. i am not hard to find. i will show them what a true conservative is. I am proud to stand behind and support trump for president and those who attack trump they can as the ted nugent song from his album spirit of the wild says they can kiss my ass. We need a leader in the vein of rambo, the man with no name clint eastwood character from his western movies, audie murphy, sergeant york, George patton, Alexander the great, william t. sherman, stone cold steve austin, with a little bit of roddy pipper thrown into the mix and we get Donald Trump. as for Ted Cruzing for a brusing Cruz is not even eligible to run because he was not born on american soil. Our forefathers only Definition of a natural born citizen is this. You must be born by legal american citizen parents on american soil. That means any of the 50 states. Not any territory like guam or puerto rico, etc. not an american embassy. Only on american soil any of the 50 states and by parents who are legal american citizens. you dont get citizenship from legal foriegners that give birth in this country nor do you get citizenship if your parents are here illegally and give birth to you. Cruz is a Canadian born citizen. Last time i checked Canada was not one of america's 50 states.  #TrumpPalin2016  #MakeOurCountryGreatAgain #TakeOurGOPPartyBack #TakeOurCountryBack.",487963981376507_488089641363941

Some people will never learn. You need to know who you are letting in your country. Know the history of Islam.

We need to wake up in this country stop paying people to come here and destroy us.

This was copied from a post by William Parrott

When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well.

Here’s how it works.

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in:

United States — Muslim 0.6% 
Australia — Muslim 1.5% 
Canada — Muslim 1.9% 
China — Muslim 1.8% 
Italy — Muslim 1.5% 
Norway — Muslim 1.8%

At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in:

Denmark — Muslim 2% 
Germany — Muslim 3.7% 
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7% 
Spain — Muslim 4% 
Thailand — Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:

France — Muslim 8% 
Philippines — Muslim 5% 
Sweden — Muslim 5% 
Switzerland — Muslim 4.3% 
The Netherlands — Muslim 5.5% 
Trinidad & Tobago — Muslim 5.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana — Muslim 10% 
India — Muslim 13.4% 
Israel — Muslim 16% 
Kenya — Muslim 10% 
Russia — Muslim 15%

After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%

At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:

Bosnia — Muslim 40% 
Chad — Muslim 53.1% 
Lebanon — Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:

Albania — Muslim 70% 
Malaysia — Muslim 60.4% 
Qatar — Muslim 77.5% 
Sudan — Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:

Bangladesh — Muslim 83% 
Egypt — Muslim 90% 
Gaza — Muslim 98.7% 
Indonesia — Muslim 86.1% 
Iran — Muslim 98% 
Iraq — Muslim 97% 
Jordan — Muslim 92% 
Morocco — Muslim 98.7% 
Pakistan — Muslim 97% 
Palestine — Muslim 99% 
Syria — Muslim 90% 
Tajikistan — Muslim 90% 
Turkey — Muslim 99.8% 
United Arab Emirates — Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic House of Peace. Here there’s supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrases are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan — Muslim 100% 
Saudi Arabia — Muslim 100% 
Somalia — Muslim 100% 
Yemen — Muslim 100%

Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.

Before Obama, there was virtually no visible presence of Islam in America. All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. All of a sudden, we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools and businesses. All of a sudden, we must stop serving pork in public places and institutions. All of a sudden, we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by America. (For God's sake, they are IN America) All of a sudden, we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who is covered up under them. All of a sudden,Muslim training compounds are popping up throughout the USA. All of a sudden, Muslims are suing employers for being expected to do their jobs. All of a sudden, all of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unsupported. All of a sudden, our troops are withdrawn from the middle east. All of a sudden, there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans, but there is endless money for Obama's refugee programs. All of a sudden, Obama fills the Federal Government with Muslims in key positions. All of a sudden, there is an ammunition shortage in the USA. All of a sudden, Americans are threatened by the Federal government for complaining about Muslims. All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do is disarm American Citizens. Now, why is it so important for Obama to disarm America? Why? Because a disarmed country is ripe for takeover by the Muslim Army that Obama has imported into the United States. Nikita Krueschev, the Russian Dictator who visited the USA in the 1950s said the USA could never be occupied by any army because of it's citizen Army. Obama knows this fact and is doing everything within his power to disarm our Citizen Army. If Obama can't do it legally, he will abuse his power and take every gun from Americans because he knows he must do that to turn the USA over to Islam. Be wary and watchful. Obama's actions speak far beyond his words. Obama won't even say the words ""Islamic Terrorist"", WHY?"".. PLEASE POST ON YOUR PAGES AND PASS THIS MESSAGE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILIES. GOD BLESS AMERICA.

Well people here is a major issue with Ted Cruz 
Mr Cruz states on TV that Trump braces the republican rhinos starting to back him and states he is part of the regular Republican Party now, and Ted Cruz says he will not work with any of them he calls all of them in house and senate the problem what is Ted Cruz going to do be like Obama and use executive orders to run this country ??? 

Is this what we really want in this country someone in office Ted Cruz that runs the White House like a dictatorship just like Obama is doing?

Someone has to be able to make good fair deal with both sides of the party right. One side controls the money / purse strings as they say and not issuing money for anything my god.
Trump can work real deals tackle real issues in this country I don't see Ted Cruse being part of the cure for what is going on in the country I see him causing a major tornado that will cause major distraction for the country in way only Obama could be used as an example .
Trump will be the man to work our security make our homeland 100% safe.
Trump will handle people crossing our boarders and people allowed to enter with poor screening.
Trump will handle getting company's back to the United States putting American jobs first above outsiders taking our company's overseas.
Trump can and will work with democrats and republicans to get done what need to be done.
Trump has the skills and mindset to deal with overseas company's and governments.

IT IS HIS SELF FUNDED CAMPAIGN!
At no other time in American history has this happened nor is it likely to happen again. He is owned by no one but we, the voters. He owes nothing to any group, person, non profit, racial, ethnic group, corporation or corporate entity, lobbyist or special interest group or whatever.
For the first time in history we have a presidential candidate we, the People, can call ours.
When the elites, of whatever ilk, attack Trump they are attacking us. As long as Donald doesn't fold, he is ours and we are his....

   ""Slavery in American was started by a black man — yikes.
The black male I am referring to is Anthony Johnson, who died in 1670. He was an Angolan slave who was freed in the Colony of Virginia in 1635.
     By 1651, Johnson owned 250 acres and had five indentured servants — four white men and one black man. In March, John Casor, the black indentured servant, demanded that Johnson set him free upon the end of his seven years of indenture
  Johnson stubbornly retorted that Casor was his servant for life and that he knew of no such indentured servitude.""

  The ultimate outcome was the courts upheld Johnson's allegation and Caso was returned to him!",487947431378162_488016714704567

Some people will never learn. You need to know who you are letting in your country. Know the history of Islam.

We need to wake up in this country stop paying people to come here and destroy us.

This was copied from a post by William Parrott

When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well.

Here’s how it works.

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in:

United States — Muslim 0.6% 
Australia — Muslim 1.5% 
Canada — Muslim 1.9% 
China — Muslim 1.8% 
Italy — Muslim 1.5% 
Norway — Muslim 1.8%

At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in:

Denmark — Muslim 2% 
Germany — Muslim 3.7% 
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7% 
Spain — Muslim 4% 
Thailand — Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:

France — Muslim 8% 
Philippines — Muslim 5% 
Sweden — Muslim 5% 
Switzerland — Muslim 4.3% 
The Netherlands — Muslim 5.5% 
Trinidad & Tobago — Muslim 5.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana — Muslim 10% 
India — Muslim 13.4% 
Israel — Muslim 16% 
Kenya — Muslim 10% 
Russia — Muslim 15%

After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%

At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:

Bosnia — Muslim 40% 
Chad — Muslim 53.1% 
Lebanon — Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:

Albania — Muslim 70% 
Malaysia — Muslim 60.4% 
Qatar — Muslim 77.5% 
Sudan — Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:

Bangladesh — Muslim 83% 
Egypt — Muslim 90% 
Gaza — Muslim 98.7% 
Indonesia — Muslim 86.1% 
Iran — Muslim 98% 
Iraq — Muslim 97% 
Jordan — Muslim 92% 
Morocco — Muslim 98.7% 
Pakistan — Muslim 97% 
Palestine — Muslim 99% 
Syria — Muslim 90% 
Tajikistan — Muslim 90% 
Turkey — Muslim 99.8% 
United Arab Emirates — Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic House of Peace. Here there’s supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrases are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan — Muslim 100% 
Saudi Arabia — Muslim 100% 
Somalia — Muslim 100% 
Yemen — Muslim 100%

Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.

Make it happen, don't expect others to give it to you: awards, included!!!! Blacks are Americans, and today, they do not have to be treated any differently than anyone else but some have chosen to make issues where there aren't issues instead of making it happen for themselves. Ben Carson made it happen for himself, others make it happen, there are plenty of examples, use those examples to further ones own career no matter where they come from or whoever they are, that is what is so great about being in America!

Donald J. Trump 1st I'm sure he was born in America and won't be a distraction. Looking at his background he will give 100% to make America Great
Again. The man loves to win, his life proves it. Overall he is a PATRIOT, Donald at 69 and billionaire doesn't need to be president, he does it for love to America.

Ted Cruz will never get to be president even if gets nominated. Democrats will sue and stop his presidency. Sarah Palin thank you, you're an intelligent woman. 

Donald J. Trump 1st I'm sure he was born in America and won't be a distraction. Looking at his background he will give 100% to make America Great
Again. The man loves to win, his life proves it. Overall he is a PATRIOT, Donald at 69 and billionaire doesn't need to be president, he does it for love to America.

2016-01-20T18:25:50+0000,"Have you read this book? Thanks

Adapted from Dr. Peter Hammond’s book: Slavery,
Terrorism and Islam:
Islam is not a religion, nor is it a cult. In its fullest form, it is a complete, total, 100% system of life. Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. The religious component is a beard
for all of the other components.
Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to
agitate for their religious privileges.
When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse
societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious
privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as
well..
Here’s how it works:
As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens.
It is a trick.
United States — Muslim 0..6%
Australia — Muslim 1.5%
Canada — Muslim 1.9%
China — Muslim 1.8%
Italy — Muslim 1.5%
Norway — Muslim 1.8%
At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic
minorities and disaffected groups, often with major
recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is
happening in:
Denmark — Muslim 2%
Germany — Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%
Spain — Muslim 4%
Thailand — Muslim 4.6%
From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population.
For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamicstandards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for
Muslims.They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature
halal on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply.
At this point, they will work to get the ruling government
to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos)
under Sharia, the Islamic Law.
The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law
over the entire world.
When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to
increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions.
In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non Muslim
action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons
and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections. FRANCE
After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting,
jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues.
At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, 
From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels.
After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some
State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these
nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim.",487260998113472_487302134776025

2016-01-20T05:38:36+0000,"(PLEASE SHARE or COPY & PASTE) My Top Ten Reasons To Support and Vote for Trump:
1. Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump’s without being able to win at the negotiating table.
3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.
10. Donald Trump loves this country – and says so. He wants to make America great again🇺🇸. 
AND
Big Bad & Bold 
Unafraid To Speak The Truth 
This Man is No Government Puppet 
The Only Man To Really Bring Back America 
A Man To Stop The Stalemate in Washington 
The Right Man To Bring Back A Wealthy America So All People Can Feel Good About The Direction This County is Headed.
We Cannot Afford To Miss A Great Opportunity To Make This Country Proud 
To Make This Country Strong To Make This Country Wealthy And To Bring This Country Together So That We The People Feel Pride in Our Nation

2016-01-20T17:32:59+0000,"(PLEASE SHARE or COPY & PASTE) My Top Ten Reasons To Support and Vote for Trump:
1. Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump’s without being able to win at the negotiating table.
3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.
10. Donald Trump loves this country – and says so. He wants to make America great again🇺🇸.

Big Bad & Bold 
Unafraid To Speak The Truth 
This Man is No Government Puppet 
The Only Man To Really Bring Back America

WHY do you people think our Government won’t secure our border? Do you think it is Incompetence? Ignorance? Is it to destroy the nation? Well a lot can be said about all of those at this point but lets just say the SPP (Security and Prosperity Partnership) CFR and that sweet little task force has other plans! Open up the borders and go deeper south into Mexico and beyond!! Awake yet???? Yes they are actively working to create a new nation of North America, called the North American Union, (NAU) just like the EU, with a controlling politburo, where members are NOT elected by the people.
Heidi Cruz was:
“SPECIAL” Assistant to Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick? Do you know WHO he is??? Mitt Romney put Zoellick on his team and caught great criticism over it but we didn’t hear about that through Fox or any one else now did we! Google it!! Just type in Romney and Robert B Zoellick. Its there!!
So WHY would Heidi be a “special assistant” to him of ALL people? Is this a lawyer doing the work of a lawyer? Hardly, there is an agenda here. 
TASK FORCE MEMBERS: HEIDI S. CRUZ is an energy investment banker with Merrill Lynch in Houston, Texas. She served in the Bush White House under Dr. Condoleezza Rice as the Economic Director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council, as the Director of the Latin America Office at the U.S. Treasury Department, and as Special Assistant to Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick, U.S. Trade Representative. Prior to government service, Ms. Cruz was an investment banker with J.P. Morgan in New York City. – (This information is prior to the economic crash, during the Bush administration.)
http://www.cfr.org/…/building-north-american…/p8102
“Special Assistant to Robert Zoellick” what did that mean? 
“Robert Bruce Zoellick is a former U.S. trade representative, deputy secretary of state, president of the World Bank, and vice chairman of Goldman Sachs (2006-2007). As U.S. trade representative, Zoellick played a key role in the passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, and the restoration of fast track negotiating authority via the Trade Act of 2002. He was also a top U.S. negotiator during the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations that lead to the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO).””U.S. Trade Representative Prior, Zoellick was appointed United States Trade Representative and assumed office on February 7, 2001. As a member Bush’s Cabinet, he served with the rank of Ambassador. Zoellick is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as the Trilateral Commission, and was one of the signers of the January 26, 1998, Project for the New American Century (PNAC) letter to President William Jefferson Clinton.[10][11] Zoellick completed negotiations to bring China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization (WTO), developed a strategy to launch new global trade negotiations at the WTO meeting at Doha, shepherded Congressional action on the Jordan Free Trade Agreement and the Vietnam Trade Agreement, and worked with Congress to pass the Trade Act of 2002, which included new Trade Promotion Authority.[12] In an October 2007 speech to the National Press Club, Zoellick stated that “we are working with our Board to significantly step up our assistance to the international efforts to address climate change. At our upcoming Annual Meetings and at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali this December, I hope to outline a portfolio of ways the World Bank Group can help integrate the needs of development and low carbon growth. We need to focus particularly on the interests of developing countries, so that we can meet the challenge of climate change without slowing the growth that will help overcome poverty.[22]

Either he lied on his bio or he is lying on the video. Either way, Saint Cruz is capable of lying. 
Why would he now hide his association with the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute and the Hispanic Leadership Fund? Could it be that he is not who he says he is? Could it be that he lies? Well going by the youtube below .. yea I’d say he lied. So where does he stand on the immigration issue? Do we really know? Seems fair to recognize that Ted Cruz has the same relationship to the Truth and the Snake in the Garden of Eden. And his wife is a Globalist operative.

2016-01-20T02:07:00+0000,"(PLEASE SHARE or COPY & PASTE) My Top Ten Reasons To Support and Vote for Trump:
1. Donald Trump is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.
2. Donald Trump knows how to negotiate. No one builds an international business empire the size of Mr. Trump’s without being able to win at the negotiating table.
3. Donald Trump is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.
4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.
5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.
6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.
7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.
8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.
9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.
10. Donald Trump loves this country – and says so. He wants to make America great again🇺🇸. 
AND
Big Bad & Bold 
Unafraid To Speak The Truth 
This Man is No Government Puppet 
The Only Man To Really Bring Back America 
A Man To Stop The Stalemate in Washington 
The Right Man To Bring Back A Wealthy America So All People Can Feel Good About The Direction This County is Headed.
We Cannot Afford To Miss A Great Opportunity To Make This Country Proud 
To Make This Country Strong To Make This Country Wealthy And To Bring This Country Together So That We The People Feel Pride in Our Nation
Please With Your Help, 
Together We Can Elect Trump 2016 
A Man That Will Make Such A Difference in Office That Everyone Will Be Proud To Call Him Their President.

Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran’s nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. 
Under Obama, a large percentage of us are on public welfare programs like food stamps, section 8 housing, and SSI, because of low wages. Health insurance is unaffordable (mine is $450/month… contrast this to my $24/month auto insurance from Insurance Panda… or my $11/month life insurance). Two thirds of young adults have student loans to which they cannot pay back due to lack of good jobs in the community. Trump didn’t do that.
Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times.
Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not.
The media is the Democratic Party.
Save your culture. Stop listening to them.

               President Trump    
                       2016      
Well people here is a major issue with Ted Cruz 
Mr Cruz states on TV that Trump braces the republican rhinos starting to back him and states he is part of the regular Republican Party now, and Ted Cruz says he will not work with any of them he calls all of them in house and senate the problem what is Ted Cruz going to do be like Obama and use executive orders to run this country ??? 

Is this what we really want in this country someone in office Ted Cruz that runs the White House like a dictatorship just like Obama is doing?

Someone has to be able to make good fair deal with both sides of the party right. One side controls the money / purse strings as they say and not issuing money for anything my god.
Trump can work real deals tackle real issues in this country I don't see Ted Cruse being part of the cure for what is going on in the country I see him causing a major tornado that will cause major distraction for the country in way only Obama could be used as an example .
Trump will be the man to work our security make our homeland 100% safe.
Trump will handle people crossing our boarders and people allowed to enter with poor screening.
Trump will handle getting company's back to the United States putting American jobs first above outsiders taking our company's overseas.
Trump can and will work with democrats and republicans to get done what need to be done.
Trump has the skills and mindset to deal with overseas company's and governments.
Vote Trump give our country a fighting chance to win for once in our life .
I vote Trump to send our men and woman into combat if need be and be there commander and chief 
To be there for our troops when they come home and take care of them.",486945848144987_487751354731103
