Claim:   List documents fifty lies told by Barack Obama. 

 

Example:   [Collected via e-mail, May 2008] 

1.) Selma Got Me Born - LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 - Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. 

2.) Father Was A Goat Herder - LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government. 

3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter - L IAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had. 

4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom - LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya. It is the first widespread violence in decades. 

5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian - LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. According to the New York Times: ""I am a strong believer of the Islamic faith,"" Ms. Obama, 85, said in a recent interview in Kenya.' Not to mention, Christianity wouldn't allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man. 

6.) My Name is African Swahili - LIAR, your name is Arabic and 'Baraka' (from which Barack came) means 'blessed' in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama. 

7.) I Never Practiced Islam - LIAR, you practiced it daily at school, where you were registered as a Muslim and kept that faith for 31 years,until your wife made you change, so you could run for office. 

8.) My School In Indonesia Was Christian - LIAR, you were registered as Muslim there and got in trouble in Koranic Studies for making faces (check your own book). 

9.) I Was Fluent In Indonesian - LIAR, not one teacher says you could speak the language. 

10.) Because I Lived In Indonesia, I Have More Foreign Experience - LIAR, you were there from the ages of 6 to 10, and couldn't even spea k the language. What did you learn, how to study the Koran and watch cartoons. 

11.) I Am Stronger On Foreign Affairs - LIAR, except for Africa (surprise) and the Middle East (bigger surprise), you have never been anywhere else on the planet and thus have NO experience with our closest allies. You seek to disarm America while our avowed enemy, Iran, will not subject itself to a nuclear ban. Top Hamas politica l adviser Ahmed Yousef said the Hamas terrorist group 'supports Obama's foreign policy vision'. 

12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion - LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify - your classmates said you were just fine. 

13.) An Ebony Article Moved Me To Run For Office - LIAR, Ebony has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn't, and never did, exist. 

14.) A Life Magazine Article Changed My Outlook On Life - LIAR, Life has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn't, and never did, exist. 

15.) I Won't Run On A National Ticket In '08 - LIAR, here you are, despite saying, live on TV, that you would not have enough experience by then, and you are all about having experience first. 

16.) Present Votes Are Common In Illinois - LIAR, they are common for YOU, but not many others have 130 NO VOTES. 

17.) Oops, I Misvoted - LIAR, only when caught by church groups and Democrats, did you beg to change your misvote. 

18.) I Was A Professor Of Law - LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE. 

19.) I Was A Constitutional Lawyer - LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE. 

20.) Without Me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill - LIAR, you didn't write it,introduce it, change it, or create it. 

21.) The Ethics Bill Was Hard To Pass - LIAR, it took just 14 days from start to finish. 

22.) I Wrote 

Report Advertisement
A Tough Nuclear Bill - LIAR, your bill was rejected by your own party for its pandering and lack of all regulation - mainly because of your Nuclear Donor, Exelon, from which David Axelrod came. 

23.) I Have Released My State Records - LIAR, as of March, 2008, state bills you sponsored or voted for have yet to be released, exposing all the special interests pork hidden within. 

24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess - LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens. You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books. 

25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America - LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill. 

26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois - LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part. 

27.) I Passed 26 Of My Own Bills In One Year - LIAR, they were not YOUR bills, but rather handed to you, after their creation by a fellow Senator, to assist you in a future bid for higher office. 

28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA - LIAR, the Candian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them. 

29.) I Am Tough On Terrorism - LIAR, you missed the Iran Resolution vote on terrorism and your good friend Ali Abunimah supports the destruction of Israel. You state you will open friendly communication with the Leader of Iran who is attempting to develop nuclear weapons to destroy us, but refuse to speak to FOX news. You are against provisions of the Patriot act which would all wiretapping of the phones of suspected terrorists in the USA. 

30.) I Am Not Acting As President Yet - LIAR, after the NAFTA Memo, a dead terrorist in the FARC, in Colombia, was found with a letter stating how you and he were working together on getting FARC recognized officially. 

31.) I Didn't Run Ads In Florida - LIAR, you allowed national ads to run 8-12 times per day for two weeks - and you still lost. 

32.) I Won Michigan - LIAR, no you didn't. 

33.) I won Nevada - LIAR, no you did not. 

34.) I Want All Votes To Count - LIAR, you said let the delegates decide. 

35.) I Want Americans To Decide - LIAR, you prefer caucuses that limit the vote, confuse the voters, force a public vote, and only operate during small windows of time. 

36.) I passed 900 Bills in the State Senate - LIAR, you passed 26, most of which you didn't write yourself. 

37.) My Campaign Was Extorted By A Friend - LIAR, that friend is threatening to sue if you do not stop saying this. Obama has stopped saying this. 

38.) I Believe In Fairness, Not Tactics - LIAR, you used tactics to eliminate Alice Palmer from running against you. 

39.) I Don't Take PAC Money - LIAR, you take loads of it. 

40.) I don't Have Lobbysists - LIAR, you have over 47 lobbyists, and counting. 

41.) My Campaign Had Nothing To Do With The 1984 Ad - LIAR, your own campaign worker made the ad on his Apple in one afternoon. 

42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace - LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients. 

43.) I Inspire People With My Words - LIAR, you inspire people with other people's words. 

44.) I Have Passed Bills In The U.S. Senate - LIAR, you have passed A BILL in the U.S. Senate - for Africa, which shows YOUR priorities. 

45.) I Have Always Been Against Iraq - LIAR, you weren't in office to vote against it AND you have voted to fund it every single time, unlike Kucinich, who seems to be out gutting you Obama. You also seem to be stepping back from your departure date - AGAIN. 

46.) I Have Always Supported Universal Health Care - LIAR, your plan leaves us all to pay the 15,000,000 who don't have to buy it. 

47.) I Only Found Out About My Investment Conflicts Via Mail - LIAR, both companies you site as having sent you letters about this conflict have no record of any such letter ever being created or sent. 

48.) I Am As Patriotic As Anyone - LIAR, you won't wear a flag pin and you don't put your hand over your heart during the Anthem. There is a Cuban Flag with Che Guevara Displayed at Barack Obama Campaign Office which you allow to be displayed. You voted against making english the official language of the United States. You voted to give illegal aliens social security benefits, which would bankrupt the social security system for Americans legally paying into it. 

49.) My Wife Didn't Mean What She Said About Pride In Country - LIAR, your wife's words follow lock-step in the vain of Rev. Wright and Louis Farrahkan, in relation to their contempt and hatred of America. 

50.) Wal-Mart Is A Company I Wouldn't Support - LIAR, your wife has received nearly a quarter of a million dollars through Treehouse, which is connected to Wal-Mart.",,status,,2016-02-23 13:00:37,0,0,0

The  fact that their editor saw fit to print the following  article about Obama and the one that appears in the latest  Newsweek, makes this a truly amazing event, and a news  story in and of itself. At last, the truth about our  President and his Agenda are starting to trickle through  the protective wall built around him by the liberal  media...

By  :  Matt  Patterson
(Newsweek  Columnist - Opinion Writer)

Years  from now, historians may regard the 2008 election of  Barack Obama as an inscrutable and phenomenon, the result  of a baffling breed of mass hysteria akin perhaps to the  witch craze of the Middle Ages. How, they will wonder, did  a man so devoid of professional accomplishment beguile so  many into thinking he could manage the world's largest  economy, direct the world's most powerful military,  execute the world's most consequential job?
Imagine  a future historian examining Obama's pre-presidential  life: ushered into and through the Ivy League, despite  unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy  non-job as a ""community organizer;"" a brief career as a  state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in  fact nearly devoid of his attention, less often did he  vote ""present""); and finally an unaccomplished single term  in the United States Senate, the entirety of which was  devoted to his presidential ambitions.

He  left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature  legislation as a legislator. And then there is the matter  of his troubling associations: the white-hating,  America-loathing preacher who for decades served as  Obama's ""spiritual mentor;"" a real-life, actual terrorist  who served as Obama's colleague and political sponsor. It  is easy to imagine a future historian looking at it all  and asking: how on Earth was such a man elected president?  There is no evidence that he ever attended or worked for  any university or that he ever sat for the Illinois bar.  We have no documentation for any of his claims. He may  well be the greatest hoax in history.Not  content to wait for history, the incomparable Norman  Podhoretz addressed the question recently in the Wall  Street Journal: To be sure, no white candidate who had  close associations with an outspoken hater of  America like  Jeremiah Wright and an unrepentant terrorist like Bill  Ayers, would have lasted a single day. But because Mr.  Obama was black, and therefore entitled in the eyes of  liberal Dom to have hung  out with protesters against  various American injustices, even if they were 'a bit'  extreme, he was given a pass. Let that Sink  in: Obama was given a pass - held to a lower standard  because of the color of his skin.  Podhoretz  continues: And in any case, what did such ancient history  matter when he was also so articulate and elegant and (as  he himself had said) ""non-threatening,"" all of which gave  him a fighting chance to become the first black president  and thereby to lay the curse of racism to rest? Podhoretz  puts his finger, I think, on the animating pulse of the  Obama phenomenon - affirmative action. Not in the legal  sense, of course. But certainly in the motivating  sentiment behind all affirmative action laws and  regulations, which are designed primarily to make white  people, and especially white liberals, feel good about  themselves. Unfortunately, minorities often suffer so that  whites can pat themselves on the back.

Liberals  routinely admit minorities to schools for which they are  not qualified, yet take no responsibility for the  inevitable poor performance and high drop-out rates which  follow. Liberals don't care if these minority students  fail; liberals aren't around to witness the  emotional devastation and deflated self-esteem  resulting from the racist policy that is affirmative  action. Yes, racist. Holding someone to a separate  standard merely because of the color of his skin - that's  affirmative action in a nutshell, and if that isn't  racism, then nothing is. And that is what  America did to Obama. True, Obama himself was  never troubled by his lack of achievements, but why would  he be? As many have noted, Obama was told he was good  enough for  Columbia despite undistinguished grades at  Occidental; he was told he was good enough for the US  Senate despite a mediocre record in  Illinois ; he was told he was good enough to be president despite no record at  all in the Senate. All his life, every step of the way,  Obama was told he was good enough for the next step, in spite of ample evidence to the contrary.

What  could this breed if not the sort of empty narcissism on display every time Obama speaks? In 2008, many who agreed that he lacked executive qualifications nonetheless raved  about Obama's oratory skills, intellect, and cool  character. Those people - conservatives included - ought now to be deeply embarrassed. The man thinks and speaks in  the hoariest of clichés, and that's when he has his Teleprompters in front of him; when the prompter is absent  he can barely think or speak at all. Not one original idea has ever issued from his mouth - it's all warmed-over Marxism of the kind that has failed over and over again for 100 years. (An example is his 2012 campaign speeches  which are almost word for word his 2008 speeches) And what  about his character? Obama is constantly blaming anything  and everything else for his troubles. Bush did it; it was  bad luck; I inherited this mess. Remember, he wanted the job, campaigned for the task. It is embarrassing to see a  president so willing to advertise his own powerless-ness, so comfortable with his own incompetence. (The other day he actually came out and said no one could have done anything to get our economy and country back on track).  But really, what were we to expect? The man has never been responsible for anything, so how do we expect him to act  responsibly?
In short: our president is a small-minded  man, with neither the temperament nor the intellect to handle his job. When you understand that, and only when you understand that, will the current erosion of liberty and prosperity make sense. It could not have gone otherwise with such an impostor in the Oval Office.",,status,,2016-02-23 09:57:27,0,0,0

***comments***

This new ""Republican"" Party is pro labor, and anti big business. They even oppose holding slaves !

Free land (see text below) ? 

What is next for these guys ? Free education ??? 

Or, even worse, combine the two concepts as land grants so colleges themselves can be public ?

Clearly, all are untenable positions to hold !

Of course, they did not do well in 1956, and, in 1860, i hear the Party will nominate a former Congressman from Illinois. 

This man, some guy named Lincoln, has no real experience in running a Nation, so he is clearly un-electable. 

IF he was elected somehow, he would not do well if he faced some serious threat to our democracy !

On Feb. 22, 1856, the Republican Party held its first national convention in Pittsburgh, Penn. The party was established in 1854 by a coalition of former Whigs, Northern Democrats and Liberal Party activists.

The party envisioned the modernization of higher education, banking, railroads, industry and cities while at the same time promising free homesteads for farmers.",Today in Legal History - February 22,link,http://public.getlegal.com/legal-info-center/feb-22-1856-republican-party-holds-first-national-convention/,2016-02-23 07:52:15,0,0,0

Tampa, FL - Today, the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida (DPCF) announced its endorsement of Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 race for the Democratic Party's nomination. Sanders earned the endorsement after receiving a supermajority of the membership's vote.
  
Statement from Susan Smith, Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida's President, on today's endorsement of Bernie Sanders for President:
 
""Throughout his political career as well as his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders has proven to be a bold progressive who is ready to fight for the values that DPCF members hold dear. Like our membership, Bernie views the problems of income inequality, institutional racism and money in politics as structural issues that must be addressed for real change to occur.
 
With today's endorsement, the DPCF is joining Bernie's political revolution by working to win the presidency as well as down-ballot races throughout Florida in 2016.
 
We are committed to running a 100% positive campaign in support of Bernie Sanders, and when the primary race is over, we will work our hardest to be sure that the Democratic nominee wins the White House in November.""

Completely Disagree with Trump about Apple. He doesn't understand how our nuclear program works, what Medicaid exactly is, and what religion itself is. Let alone how an iPhone works and what exactly it would mean to unlock the phone. The list goes on and on. This man is dangerously close to the White House. The sheeple are clueless. Our rights are alarmingly being taken away systematically. We have drones flying over our own country, spying on our own citizens. We have American citizens rotting away at Gitmo. Which is by the way still open for business. Due process, anyone remember that? We have a terror watch list. We believe that flying on an airplane is a right. Unfortunately, air travel wasn't around, when our forefathers were. Yet, the lobbyists allow these so called ""terrorists"" to purchase any type of gun. Even our right to vote has been taken away. See, Superdelagates and Bush's ""win"" in 2000. That was the true Y2K! This is not just about the right to privacy. It's a matter of national security. Once Pandora's Box is opened, there's no turning back. If this ability to open the back door is realized, it will get to the wrong people. Maybe the government doesn't even have one of the San Bernardino Shooter's iPhone. Maybe they just figured out that they have a chance to get the ability to do this to anyone of their choosing. This entire ordeal feels like one big conspiracy theory. Yet, it's actually not. When we have a congress that said on the record that they would rather see Obama fail, then America succeed! That sounds like a conspiracy theory. Yet, it's actually on record. Just as they said that they would never approve of any nominee for the Supreme Court by President Obama. Just Hours after Mr. Scalia passed away. All they had to do was just delay the process. But, they are at a point where they can just say the truth and get away with it. Hopefully, the latter is wrong. So, a full year with no Supreme Court! All those cases just waiting to be heard. Most will see a 4-4 tie and the Appellate Court's decision will stand. What a waste of time and tax payers dollars. We hope that you have made it this far. If so, thank you. Also, please visit our page

of the Black Civil Rights Movement

Many observers argue that the presumed Jewish altruism and social activism in the American civil rights movement of the 1960's had baser motives. Benjamin Ginsberg argues that the multicultural coalitions spearheaded by Jews in the civil rights era ""was a political tactic"" to ""undermine the power"" of those establishment social forces that hindered further Jewish socio-economic advancement. [GINSBERG, p. 125] In 1975 Hasia Dinner wrote a PhD thesis about the way that ""Jewish support for black causes was a way for Jews to broaden their own rights without becoming conspicuous by advocating their group interests."" [FEINGOLD, p. 130] ""Jewish leaders,"" wrote Diner, ""representing different socio-economic classes, ideologies, and cultural experiences committed themselves to black betterment and gave time, money, and energy to black organizations. The spectrum was so wide and the involvement so extensive that one must conclude that these leaders acted out of peculiarly Jewish motives ... [My] book demonstrates that Jewish ends were secured by involvement with blacks."" [DINER, p. xiv, xii]",,status,,2016-02-21 10:30:31,0,0,0

Just like Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor , December 7, 1941.

This picture was taken in February 2014 in Norfolk , Virginia. Obama ordered 5 nuclear carriers into harbor for ""routine"" (?) inspections. Heads of the Navy were flabbergasted by the directive but had to comply as it was a direct order from their Commander-in-Chief.

The carriers were all pulled out from the MIDDLE EAST and the Afghanistan support role leaving our land forces naked and exposed without the air support needed to carry out their missions.

NORFOLK, VA. (February 8, 2014). This is the first time since WWII that five aircraft carriers were docked together. (These are all nuclear carriers).USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), 
USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77),
USS Enterprise (CVN 65),
USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75),
and USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72)

These are all in port at Naval Station Norfolk, Va., the world's largest naval station.

Knowledgeable sources stated that this breached a long standing military
protocol in the Navy meant to avoid a massive enemy strike on major US forces. 

(U..S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Ryan J. Courtade/Released).

This ordering of most of the Navy's capitol ships into one place is unprecedented since Pearl Harbor!

Since Barack Obama has been in the White House, high ranking military officers have been removed from their positions at a rate that is absolutely unprecedented. Things have gotten so bad that a number of retired generals are publicly speaking out about the 'purge' of the U.S. military that they believe is taking place. As you will see below, dozens of highly decorated military leaders have been dismissed from their positions over the past few years. So why is this happening? What is going on right now is absolutely crazy especially during a time of peace. Is there a deliberate attempt to reshape the military and remove those who don't adhere to the proper 'viewpoints' ? Does someone out there feel a need to get officers that won't cooperate out of the way?

Throughout world history, whatever comes next after a military purge is never good. If this continues, what is the U.S. military going to look like in a few years? Perhaps you are reading this and you think that 'purge' is too strong a word for what is taking place.

Well, just consider the following quotes from some very highly decorated retired officers:

Retired Army Major General Paul Vallely: 
The White House protects their own. That's why they stalled on the investigation into fast and furious, Benghazi and Obamacare. He's intentionally weakening and gutting our military, Pentagon and reducing us as a superpower, and anyone in the ranks who disagrees or speaks out is being purged.

Retired Army Major General Patrick Brady:
There is no doubt he (Obama) is intent on emasculating the military and will fire anyone who disagrees with him.

Retired Army Lt. General William G. Jerry Boykin:

Over the past three years, it is unprecedented for the number of four-star generals to be relieved of duty, and not necessarily relieved for cause.

Retired Navy Captain Joseph John: I believe there are more than 137 officers who have been forced out or given bad evaluation reports so they will never make Flag (officer), because of their failure to comply to certain views.

A Pentagon official who asked to remain nameless, because they were not authorized to speak on the matter said: Even young officers, down through the ranks have been told not to talk about Obama or the politics of the White House. They are purging everyone and if you want to keep your job just keep your mouth shut. Now this trend appears to be accelerating.

General Vallely's comment:
Coincidence? Every communist regime on the planet did this as soon as they gained power.  I am doing my part by sending this email, I hope you will do the same.

PROOF (with links):

TRUMP AIRLINES - In October 1988, Donald Trump threw his wallet into the airline business by purchasing Eastern Air Shuttle, a service that for 27 years had run hourly flights between Boston, New York City and Washington, D.C. For roughly $365 million, Trump got a fleet of 17 Boeing 727s, landing facilities in each of the three cities and the right to paint his name on an airplane. But his gamble was a bust. A lack of increased interest from customers combined with high pre–Gulf War fuel prices meant the shuttle never turned a profit. The high debt forced Trump to default on his loans, and ownership of the company was turned over to creditors. The Trump Shuttle ceased to exist in 1992.

TRUMP CASINOS - Donald Trump's gambles don't always go as planned. Especially when that gamble is gambling itself. In February 2009, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the third time in a row — an extremely rare feat in American business. The casino company, founded in the 1980s, runs the Taj Mahal, the Trump Plaza and the Trump Marina. Trump defended himself by distancing himself from the company, though he owned 28% of its stock. ""Other than the fact that it has my name on it — which I'm not thrilled about — I have nothing to do with the company,"" he said. He resigned from Trump Entertainment soon after that third filing, but in August of that year he, and an affiliate of Beal Bank Nevada, agreed to buy the company for $100 million. 

TRUMP MARRIAGES - Donald Trump's life in the bedroom has been messy at best. The real estate magnate married his first wife, Ivana, in 1977, but things got rocky after Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples surfaced in New York City tabloids. ""You bitch, leave my husband alone!"" Ivana told Maples on a ski trip in Aspen, Colo. Ivana's warning fell on deaf ears, and in 1992, Trump left her with a reported $25 million settlement and married his mistress one year later. His marriage to Maples was even shorter-lived, and the couple divorced in 1999. These days, Trump is married to Slovenian supermodel Melania Knauss. 

TRUMP MORTGAGE - In April 2006, Trump announced that, after years in the real estate business, he was launching a mortgage company. He held a glitzy press conference at which his son Donald Jr. predicted that Trump Mortgage would soon be the nation's No. 1 home-loan lender. Trump told CNBC, ""Who knows more about financing than me?"" Apparently, plenty. Within a year and a half, Trump Mortgage had closed shop. The would-be lending powerhouse was done in by timing (the housing market cratered in 2007) and ironically enough, given Trump's Apprentice TV show, poor hiring. The executive Trump selected to run his loan company, E.J. Ridings, claimed to have been a top executive at a prestigious investment bank. In reality, Ridings' highest role on Wall Street was as a registered broker, a position he held for a mere six days.

TRUMP UNIVERSITY - They hoped to get rich off real estate, so they enrolled in Donald Trump’s University to learn the tricks of the trade, some of them maxing out their credit cards to pay tens of thousands of dollars for insider knowledge they believed could make them wealthy.

Do you remember Trump University? Probably not — founded in 2005, it didn’t really catch on. And one big reason it didn’t catch on is because it was a total scam, say former students in complaints that were filed to the Federal Trade Commission and were unearthed by a Freedom of Information Act recently requested by Gizmodo.

“I want my $35,000+ back. All I got was books that I could have gotten from the library that could guide me better then Trump’s class did."" Another grievance describes a strategy reminiscent of Scientology. After paying $1,495 for a three-day seminar, which provided information freely available on Zillow, “attendees were told that unless they purchased additional products (software; individual coaching) they would not succeed,” the complaint states.

In 2013, the New York Attorney General’s office filed a $40 million lawsuit against the former reality star and current Republican presidential candidate for failing to impart the promised real estate education on 5,000 students and subjecting prospective students to high-pressure sales tactics. In April 2015, a judge ruled that Trump was indeed personally responsible and that the matter would go to trial. A class-action suit against Trump related to Trump University is also pending.

TRUMP VODKA - Trump vodka was introduced in 2006 to much fanfare. At the time, Trump predicted the T&T (Trump and Tonic) would become the most requested drink in America. On Larry King Live, he said he got into the vodka business to outdo his friends at Grey Goose. Ten years later, Grey Goose is still on top shelves throughout the country. As for Trump vodka? Yeah, we'd never heard of it either. The New York City blog Gothamist reported the vodka stopped production ""because the company failed to meet the threshold requirements."" In 2011, Trump's company filed an injunction to prevent an ISRAELI company from selling Trump vodka without his consent or authorization. Meaning the Donald stopped the only people in world who wanted to drink his vodka from doing so.

CHINA CONNECTION - ""The problem with our country is we don't manufacture anything anymore,"" Donald Trump told Fox News recently. ""The stuff that's been sent over from China,"" he complained, ""falls apart after a year and a half. It's crap."" That very same Donald Trump has his own line of clothing, and it's made in ... China. (OK, OK — not all of it. Salon, which reported this intriguing, head-scratching fact, notes that some of his apparel is from MEXICO and Bangladesh.)

BANKRUPTCIES - Donald Trump brags about how well his businesses have fared. Yet, no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump's casino empire in the last 30 years[*].

In 1990, the banking institutions that backed his real estate investments had to bail him out with a $65 million ""rescue package"" that contained new loans and credit. But it wasn't enough, and in 1991 the famous developer was nearly $4 billion in debt and his famous Taj Mahal casino had to file bankruptcy, [with another bankruptcy for Trump Castle Associates being filed in 1992*]. Trump's economic troubles continued through the '90s, while he was personally leveraged to nearly $1 billion. In 2004, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts also filed for bankruptcy. In 2009, the same company (by then renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc.) filed for bankruptcy again.

Seeping in through polls and pronouncements geared to manage expectations ahead of the Nevada caucuses, there is a creeping sense that Sanders might just attract not only white women but a surprising number of the people of color that pundits describe as Clinton’s “firewall.”

This is American politics at peak neoliberalism, where a distorted version of identity politics is used to defend an oligarchy and a national security state, celebrating diversity in the management of exploitation and warfare.""",Hillary Clinton’s cynical race appeals: The revenge of neoliberal identity politics,link,http://www.salon.com/2016/02/19/hillary_clintons_cynical_race_appeals_the_revenge_of_neoliberal_identity_politics/,2016-02-19 16:05:43,2,0,0

Not voting is like a vote for the Republicans."" Not one Republican cadidate even remotely acknowledges science or ""liberty for all."" American imperalism has been the cause of more damage and more casualties than any other developed nation of all time.  
   For example, most people in the middle East belive that islamic terriosm is a direct cause of U.S intervention. When Regan was president he gave money to the Taliaban to fight the Soviet Union. They later went on to use those same wepons against us and there own citizens, along with  funding other terriost groups. Also, the Bin Laden family and the Saudis were huge investors in The Bush's Oil company. 
    America makes its money by distributing arms to the whole world, overthrowing democratically elected leaders and installing murdering dictators with our best interests in mind.  Then we go invade the same country we sold wepons to and kill the innocent people living there. 
    America is founded on killing Native Americans and slavery. It's safe to say that America has its ""bad moments in history"" just like any other developed nation. 
    With that being said, democratic socialism is different than just socialism (which btw isn't communism.) Some examples are: Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Canada ( nations with low crime, low gun violence, free college, guaranteed health care, financial surpluses) basically the best places to live in the world.
    In conclusion, the world has seen it's fair share of tragedies caused by Government. And America is by far not exempt from the list. It's amazing that when a candidate comes around talking about providing free college and universal health care, the right losses there minds. When our tax dollars have gone to much worse! Maybe if we want to stop terriosm we should stop creating it by or our western imperlistic foreign policy. That's all I'm saying man.",,status,,2016-02-19 14:33:40,0,0,0

346937065399354_1071622002930853,"From:      The Modjeskis’ Society Dedicated to Preservation of Cultures (MS)
To:           Hon. President Barack Obama, February 17, 2016:

                                                   MOTION
When in 1964 future Director of the MS, W.Czajkowski  commenced materialization of President D.D. Eisenhower’s  PEOPLE TO PEOPLE program of September 1956, he became friend with the US Post Master General J. Gronouski  and President of the Detroit’s Polish-American Chamber of Commerce, C.A. Kozdroj, and thus got involved in issues of international significance. 

To actions, presented with this MOTION in separate attachments, is included the case of PULASKI CLAN, which in 1768 declared war against Russia. The upraising of Pulaskis, the Confederation of Bar, had been a precursor to the American Revolution (AR), and French as well.

Heroes of the AR, Casimir Pulaski and Thaddeus Kosciusko laid the foundation to the abolishment of slavery. Kosciusko dedicated his fortune to setting Negroes free, and to the enslaved Nation of Poland he introduced American Constitution, on May 3rd of each year celebrated by the Polish People everywhere, in this way promoting the PAX AMERICANA, invoked by President J.F. Kennedy in his famous 1993 speech. Recently the UNESCO recognized year 2017 as 200th anniversary of Kosciusko’s death.    

To commemorate  both heroes of the AR, and no less heroic participants of the US’ Reconstruction Era, Ralph Modjeski, his mother Helena and their spiritus movens Ignacy                 J. Paderewski, ever since 1986 the MS is striving for establishment of the NATIONAL MODJESKA HISTORICAL DISTRICT (NMHD), approx. 2000 acres large, with added to it 800 acres under a care of the Federal Aviation Administration on the former Marine Corps Art Station El Toro in Orange County, California, called a Habitat Preserve.
To this MS’ project might also be added 850 acres of land owed to the Pulaski Clan by the US for services rendered in the American Revolutionary Army by the Brigadier-General  C. Pulaski, other debts notwithstanding.   

The NMHD might be financed in accordance with the INVESTMENT FUND HELENA MODRZEJEWSKA  (see the attached PRTCIAC), in concurrence with the indifference of President B. Clinton of 1994, rejected by President of Poland L. Kaczynski in 2006. 

Since January 5, 2016 the MS is persuading the New Government of Poland to start a dispute with Government of the USA in order to realize the NHMD and does believe, that Hon. President B. Obama in that respect will meet Hon. President Andrzej Duda and aftewards will issue a PROCLAMATION (suggestion attached), finalizing the case of NHMD. Morerover, the NHMD as a CULTURAL SHIELD will put Poland among European Nations in a firm position. The NHMD may also embrace the project COSMOPOLIS, concerning Nicolaus Copernicus (see attachment).

With highest regards – Wieslaw Czajkowski.
Cc:  Hon. Andrzej Duda.

                                                 PROCLAMATION

                                                        (Proposal)

Taking into consideration the real motives for establishment of an agricultural colony by Poland’s Patriots, in 1876 on the territory of the USA for the purpose of emanating the idea of American Freedom in their country, since 1796 until 1918 occupied  by Russia, Prussia and Austria, I, President, Barack Obama, do PROCLAIM, that after the year 2016, the Modjeska National Historical Landmark in Modjeska Canyon, Orange County, California, hitherto known as the Helena Modjeska Historic House and Gardens,within boundaries of homesteads own by Helena Modrzejewska/Modjeska and her husband Karol Chlapowski-Bozenta, be reverted into its previous splendor, and be further called THE MODJESKA HISTORICAL DISTRICT, perpetuating bonds existing between Polish and American Nations, and be maintained by Poland in cooperation with the USA.  

And  I do also PROCLAIM, that the land on the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro under care of the US Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration as a HABITAT PRESERVE, be cooperated with the DISTRICT, as stated.

346937065399354_1071321789627541,"WHY I WANT TO BE DADE COUNTY FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN CLERK OF COURT AND COUNTY CLERK BY RUBIN YOUNG

ELECT WRITE-IN CANDIDATE RUBIN YOUNG DADE COUNTY FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN CLERK OF COURT & COUNTY CLERK

My dearest Dade County;

Over the last 43 years, I have seen the deaths, the destruction and the devastation of many lives in this county. I have seen family members die senselessly because of a lack of respect for humanity and others self-worth.

I have seen children and families starve due to a lack of resources that should be freely given and freely received from their government.

When you have lived in communities destroyed by poverty during the day and by gun fire during the night; then you should have a basic understanding as to why I want you to Elect Write-In Candidate Rubin Young, Dade County First African American Clerk of Court and County Clerk.

We say each and everyone of us ""I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”.

""For all"" it means we are all our brothers and sisters keepers. We should not be treating each other differently because of ""Shades of Grey"" that lives on the outside of you and me. Is my red heart the same as everyone else, is my red lungs the same as everyone else, do I not bleed red blood when cut like everyone else, so why are we treating each other differently because of a so-called skin color.

I don't believe in discrimination against a person's race, gender, personal preference, political background or skin color; we are all part of a Giant humanity. A humanity that is bigger than you or I; no matter how much money you have in the bank, no matter how much education you possess, no matter how big your home, and no matter how much property you have listed in your name.

We are all God's children and we are all part of his humanity.
In a county that is more culturally diversed as Dade County, we need each other. My family in 1896, came from the Bahamas and they settled in Homestead and Coconut Grove during the time Mr. Henry Flagler starting building his railroads.

It was during a time of much prosperity and progress because we needed one another to get ahead. That is why I believe that the essential elements of our success rest in my becoming Dade County's first African American Clerk of Court and County Clerk. I want to work on behalf of people and communities neglected and abused by a system which refuses to ""Let My People Go"".

As a county administrator, who has the background and experience to be Mr. Clerk and make Dade County government more people oriented and accountable? I promise that there will no longer be companies in this county that discriminate against people or ethnic groups looking for work; that we will no longer have elections stolen from people deserving of a public seat; that we will no longer have elected officials and non-profit groups endorsing political candidates as mentioned in F.S. 104.061 or using their corrupt influences to sway local, state municipal and/or county elections.

We will no longer have misappropriation or diversion of taxpayer’s funds from one community or neighborhood to another, there will no longer be fraudulent foreclosures filed by attorneys without the original signer of the mortgagee signature or on the contract for legal standing, there will no longer be illegal property home value assessments, no internet auctions or property tax increases that remove homestead exemptions fraudulently in this county under my leadership, there will be no mistreatment of senior citizens living in nursing homes or assisted living neighborhoods and/or single mothers and their children living on housing assistance being discriminated.

As Dade County Clerk of Court and County Clerk, I stand will all unions in the fair negotiations of their contracts and their rights to organize.

Why I know pain and I know what disappointment feels like which should be part of the job’s qualifications.

This county must become the highest example for our children and the message that we send to them must be different than the messages of the past.

My goals are to make Dade County adhere to spending priorities as mentioned in our Home-Rule Charter. So I am asking for this opportunity as my future employers to allow me to make history and to show that Dade County is a county that believes in progress, cultural diversity and economic opportunity. We also need to finally do right by Mary L. Hill, founder of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, 1972, 1978 and the Community Service Act of 1974.

As a county let’s take responsibility and return this woman back into her position as the “National Regional Community Service Director” removed unlawfully by our government and let us “Free Drewery Geter” from prison for a crime that he did not commit, but due to misrepresentation by an attorney he now serves life in prison for a crime he did not commit after getting out of the United States Army where he served 10 long years.

Please join me and demand that this government “FREE DREWERY GETER” and “RESTORE MARY L. HILL as NATIONAL REGIONAL COMMUNITY SERVICE DIRECTOR”.

There will be great heartaches, strives, changes and strong differences of opinions, yet we must still stay together for all times.

Let’s also address how much more money Dade County needs in dealing with the problems of ""Rising Sea Levels"" which should be a priority within this county on behalf of our children.

My dearest Dade County, we must not see ourselves as many races, many cultures and/or many diverse communities; we must see ourselves as ""One Beloved Community"" for generations to come.

Let us make Dade County responsible for every citizen and not only by single member districts that are still part of Dade County. 

Let us become a county that is opening up doors which leads through doors of humanity for all to enter ""Let My People Go"".

Every day, the nation’s law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal levels—including the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)—use investigative resources to target the supply side in the war against drugs.

But even with numerous law enforcement successes in this area, the demand for drugs continues. And one of the more worrisome trends is a growing epidemic of prescription opiate and heroin abuse, especially among young people.

Today, in an effort to help educate students and young adults about the dangers of opioid addiction, the FBI and DEA unveiled a documentary called Chasing the Dragon: The Life of an Opiate Addict at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., before an audience of educational leaders from the region. The 45-minute film, whose title refers to the never-ending pursuit of the original or ultimate high, features stark first-person accounts told by individuals who have abused opioids or whose children have abused opioids, with tragic consequences.

“This film may be difficult to watch,” explains FBI Director James Comey, “but we hope it educates our students and young adults about the tragic consequences that come with abusing these drugs and that it will cause people to think twice before becoming its next victim.”

And according to Acting DEA Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, “The numbers are appalling—tens of thousands of Americans will die this year from drug-related deaths, and more than half of these deaths are from heroin and prescription opioid overdoses. I hope this [documentary] will be a wakeup call for folks.",Chasing the Dragon,video,https://youtu.be/p4B6DMM9Bqg,2016-02-17 23:39:49,0,0,0

Simply one of the worst pieces of journalistic opinion I have read recently is in today's Wall Street Journal, Opinion page, by Joseph Epstein.  I buy the physical paper to read up on the ""other side"" so I don't have access to the electronic version, sorry.

The piece is an attempt at clever criticism of Sanders (and Hillary seems to be repeating it endlessly): to characterize him as a candidate with ""one idea"", which he is not.  All while we have Trump saying ""make America great"" (one idea with no details); oh wait, I forgot, build a wall between us and Mexico, yeah, what a great and immensely practical idea, it is NOT.  And then Cruz, Rubio, Bush, Kasich, and Carson, oh please, don't even get me started on how singular and singularly bigoted and stupid their platforms are.  

Bernie, my advice?  ""Stay the course, Dude, stay the course.""

(Note: every analogy this guy Joseph Epstein makes between his theory and other notable people or concepts throughout history, well, let's just say that they are beyond ludicrous, distort the context of events, and simply muddy the waters with a simpleminded opinion from a guy known for homophobia whose recent book is called ""Masters of the Game: Essays and Stories on Sport"".

We picked up Social Democracy a while ago, and in fact, it works pretty well. You should try it too. But, we have understood that things that come with SD are not your cup of tea. Here are some examples: 1 year paid maternity leave, 25 days paid vacation(in addition to all Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays), free healthcare, average income $56.000, average tax rate 30% (yes, no more, if more people pay a decent amount of tax, it will benefit all of us), unemployment rate 4%, lowest killing rate in the world, lowest amount of poor people in the world - and so we can keep it going. It’s a hell!!! At this point I am sure some of you are reaching for the commie card. But just leave it in the drawer. We are highly sophisticated modern, technological and marked oriented countries, but we have understood one tiny little thing that is very, very hard for you over there to understand – if you share a little bit more – everyone could be a little happier. This is SD and how easy it actually works. You did quite well in the 50ies, 60ies and 70ies. If you vote for the right candidate this time, maybe you can start on the journey back to your glory days? Just kidding, of course! In the months ahead, watching your showtime up to election day, will entertain us a lot. Thank you for that. In the meantime you can watch this brilliant video to keep up the mood and your famous patriotism. Good luck, from the dungeons of the world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w86QhV7whjs

The idea of ""greed is good"" is at the heart of the very foundation of capitalism. It is that very concept that brought on the Great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession of 2008. At its very core is the principle of maximizing profits at the expense of workers; avoid paying federal income taxes, and doing anything and everything, oftentimes immoral or illegal to make a profit. Profit is more important than people; it's more important than family; it's more important than the environment.
 
I imagine all of my conservative friends heads are exploding right about now. ""Oh my god, he's anti-capitalism."" Nothing could be further from the truth. However, I am anti-unregulated capitalism. I reject the notion that greed is good. I don't believe in the psychosis of profits over people, families and communities that afflict the overwhelming majority of corporations in America today or the intense aversion to allowing workers to form unions and collectiveIy bargain. After all it was unions that created the greatest middle class the world has ever known.

That's why it is absolutely no coincidence that the decline of real wages and the destruction of the middle class is happening at the very same time that workforce union participation is at its lowest it has been in 3 decades. It's also no coincidence that states with a strong union presence have better wages, better benefits and better workplace safety than so called ""right to work"" states like Texas or Kansas. 

Over the last 30 years, wages have not kept up with worker productivity or the cost of living. And that is by no accident. It's very much an intended outcome. It's a conscience decision by corporations and CEO's to keep wages low and it's exactly what Reaganomics (""trickle down"") was designed to do from the very beginning.

Working 2, 3 and sometimes 4 jobs and still not being able to make ends meet or not being able to afford to send a child to college or stay in your home after a lengthy hospital stay is not what the American dream is supposed to be about.

We can rebuild the middle class, we know how to do this. FDR gave us the blueprint after the Great Depression, but it's going to take millions of Americans, who are overwhelmingly conservative, to remove the blinders from their eyes and stop voting against their own best economic self interests. Contrary to what most poor and working class conservatives may erroneously believe, the economic interests of the super wealthy and the rest of us are not the same. 

This misguided notion that certain occupations like fast food worker; a Walmart cashier or being a janitor doesn't deserve the dignity of a living wage is exactly what CEO's who make tens of thousands of dollars an hour and Billionaires like the Koch brothers want you to believe. If a full time job doesn't afford you the ability to maintain a home and take care of a family, then what exactly is the point; the privilege of making someone else rich??!! 

It's time to start respecting and honoring labor in this country once again. Conservative orthodoxy is effectively destroying the middle class in this country and it's time for ordinary hardworking Americans to stand up and fight back. 

If you are not in a Union, you need to join one. If there is no union at your place of employment, create one. Unions raise the standards of living of workers in this country, it's as simple as that. 

And finally, stop voting for individuals that do not respect labor or workers' rights. Stop sending folks to Washington that don't believe in raising the minimum wage to a living wage; or believe that workers shouldn't have the right to collectively bargain with their employers. 

In other words, conservative working class, start valuing yourselves, and stop selling yourselves short. Even you deserve a living wage. Even you deserve safe work conditions. Understand what you bring to the table and know that your labor should be honored and respected, and compensated as such. That's the least your employer should do. And it doesn't matter whether you flip burgers at Burger King or make widgets at some factory. #voteblue #joinaunion #BernieSanders2016",,status,,2016-02-16 12:54:31,0,0,0

If we stay home and they win you can't turn around and whine about the choices they make. If they win this year, they will likely keep the House and Senate. Along with a Conservative Court you can kiss so many of your rights away. Abortion will no longer be legal, voting rights will be stripped back to the segregation days, and Health care will be only for those who can afford it.They will tell you we are making it up or just blowing smoke. I would not trust them to tell me today it is Monday. We already have them on record what they are going to do. We have seen Texas and North Carolina already try to make voting more difficult. We already have seen close to 60 votes to repeal the ACA. If they win in November you can kiss that goodbye.

346937065399354_1068435116582875,"Is there a petition to declare support for a recess appointment to replace Scalia?

Although it seems (again) that President Obama's (sometimes maddening) MODERATION makes him resistant to this, Republican EXTREMISM creates a perfect storm for such action, since the Senate is in a 10-day recess. Here are the facts (from Instapundit):

COULD OBAMA MAKE A RECESS APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE SCALIA?: The answer appears to be “yes,” because (once again), the GOP-controlled Senate voluntarily has left itself vulnerable to the exercise of such presidential power. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution gives the President power to fill vacancies “during the recess of the Senate”:
The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.
There’s a lot of misinformation out there. For example, a report by Fox News mistakenly focuses on the Adjournment Clause of Article I, section 5, which merely states that neither House of Congress may adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other. The Fox News reporter wrongly concludes:
[S]o long as both the House and Senate haven’t jointly agreed to “adjourn” for a stretch longer than three days, then there appears to be no way the president could make a recess appointment.
But the House and Senate are not operating under those circumstances right now. Both bodies of have adjourned until later this month for the President’s Day recess.
The Senate last met on Thursday. When doing so, it approved a “conditional adjournment resolution” for the Senate not to meet again until Monday, Feb. 22. The House met on Friday and at the close of business adopted the same adjournment resolution to get in sync with the Senate. The House is out until Tuesday, Feb. 23.
So, the House and Senate will not be meeting in the coming days. This is an adjournment and is not challengeable in court the way the NLRB recess appointments were because both bodies have agreed with each other to adjourn.
Whether the House of Representatives is in adjournment is irrelevant to the Recess Appointments Clause power. The only salience of the Adjournment Clause is that, in NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014), the Supreme Court looked to the Adjournment Clause as relevant evidence in its quest to ascertain a minimum period of time for determining the meaning of a “Recess of the Senate” in the Recess Appointments Clause. Specifically, the Court concluded:
The Adjournments Clause reflects the fact that a 3-day break is not a significant interruption of legislative business. As the Solicitor General says, it is constitutionally de minimis. A Senate recess that is so short that it does not require the consent of the House is not long enough to trigger the President’s recess-appointment power. . . .
If a Senate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of the House, it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. And a recess lasting less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.
Thus, a Senate recess of fewer than 3 days is not enough to trigger the President’s recess appointment power; the Senate’s recess must be at least ten days in duration.
So how long is the Senate’s present recess? It began on Friday, February 12, with the passage of S. Con. Res. 31 which states:
That when the Senate recesses or adjourns on any day from Thursday, February 11, 2016, through Saturday, February 20, 2016, on a motion offered pursuant to this concurrent resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee, it stand recessed or adjourned until 12:00 noon on Monday, February 22, 2016, or such other time on that day as may be specified by its Majority Leader or his designee in the motion to recess or adjourn, or until the time of any reassembly pursuant to section 2 of this concurrent resolution, whichever occurs first; . . .
Sec. 2. (A) The Majority Leader of the Senate or his designee, after concurrence with the Minority Leader of the Senate, shall notify the Members of the Senate to reassemble at such place and time as he may designate if, in his opinion, the public interest shall warrant it.
A Senate recess from February 12 (at noon) until February 22 (at noon) is a recess of exactly 10 days. Thus, under Noel Canning, the Senate is potentially in recess, and President Obama’s recess appointments power may be exercised.
Under S. Con. Res. 31, the only way to recall the Senate back into business before February 22 is with the “concurrence [of] the Minority Leader of the Senate,” Harry Reid (D-NV). Somehow I doubt Sen. Reid will grant such concurrence to reconvene, should President Obama decide to use this 10-day recess to make a recess appointment and replace Justice Scalia. But should President Obama try use this particular 10-day recess to replace Justice Scalia, the replacement would only be constitutionally permitted to serve until the end of the next session– i.e., until the end of the 1st session of the 115th Congress, which would be sometime in early January 2018. [H/T to Mike Rappaport and Casey M for noting this, as my original post referenced the end of the current session].
But there is another potential wrinkle. Specifically, the Congressional Record of February 12 shows that Senate declared that it would be in pro forma session (where a member of the Senate gavels in and gavels out every few days), declaring:
A unanimous-consent agreement was reached providing that when the Senate completes its business on Friday, February 12, 2016, it adjourn, to then convene for pro forma sessions only, with no business being conducted on the following dates and times, and that following each pro forma session, the Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Monday, February 15, 2016, at 11:00 a.m., and Thursday, February 18, 2016, at 9:00 a.m.; and that when the Senate adjourns on Thursday, February 18, 2016, it next convene at 3:00 p.m., on Monday, February 22, 2016, unless the Senate receives a message from the House of Representatives that it has adopted S. Con. Res. 31; and that if the Senate receives such a message, it stand adjourned until 3:00 p.m., on Monday, February 22, 2016.
Notice, however, that the pro forma status of the Senate’s recess is made conditional: “unless the Senate receives a message from the House of Representatives that it has adopted S. Con. Res. 31; and that if the Senate receives such a message, it stand [sic] adjourned until 3:00 p.m., on Monday, February 22, 2016.”
This matters because if the Senate is in pro forma session, the Noel Canning majority agreed that such pro forma sessions will block the president’s recess appointment power:
We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.
Unfortunately for the GOP Senate, however, the GOP-controlled House agreed to S. Con. Res. 31 on February 12 without objection. This means that under the plain language of S. Con. Res 31, the Senate is “in recess”–and not in pro forma session.
If this is indeed the case, the Senate is presently in the midst of a 10-day recess (not a pro forma session), and under Noel Canning, President Obama possesses the power to make a recess appointment to the Supreme Court until noon on February 22, when the Senate comes back in session.",,status,,2016-02-15 11:10:51,1,0,1

He has always rejected using opinions of lower courts, world views, or social economical changes in the country to assist him in coming to a just opinion. He insisted that he would use the written words of the constitution to guide him in forming his opinions. He was known for his sharply worded dissents and caustic attacks on liberalism no matter how much his dissents injured the country or provided for misguided justice.
 
 President Obama says he will nominate a successor to Justice Scalia, and he should. Republicans, even before they knew if the news of Scalia’s death was true or not was lining up vowing that President Obama would be blocked from appointing a new justice. It should be noted that the Constitution clearly states that the President will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court. There is no mention that appointments should be delayed for election year politics or for any other reason. Republicans, as one of their often used tenets claims to be strong constitutionist or other words to impedes change in this country. 

 Justice Scalia has claimed that the Constitution is an institutionalized mechanism of power control, which controls the power of the citizenry; meaning the constitution should never be changed. He believed, that if the constitution says you are a slave then you are a slave. He believed, that It means that if the constitution says that women cannot vote, then women cannot vote. The most important thing that we face this date is, if the Republicans are successful in thwarting this President and block his appointment of a new justice we must mobilize like we have never mobilized before and elect a democrat to be the next President of the United States of America.",,status,,2016-02-15 01:56:56,0,0,0

Ted Cruz said the U.S. has 'lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. He's talking about the labor force participation rate. The reason is because the large population of baby boomers born in the 1950s are all retiring and people are living longer. So there is a smaller percentage of people working, true. Retired people don't want to work but are still included in this calculation. The labor force participation rate is irrelevant and not related to any president especially when a large group of people are happily retiring under a good economy. The relevant statistic should be the unemployment rate and under Obama it went from about 10% to 4.5% unemployment.

That's what our country has stood for for centuries. Gee, how many Presidents were white men? That's right, almost ALL OF them. White men are *automatically* promoted above more qualified minority men and women. It has got to stop! And I'm sorry to have to say this to all the young hopefuls but Burn is inadvertently setting you up for a fall. ALL Democrats want more people in school and fewer people in jail. ALL democrats want college to be affordable for everyone. ALL democrats want everyone to vote. But you can't just wave a magic wand or sprinkle fairy dust to ""make it so."" Young people were disappointed when Obama was elected that they didn't wake up the next morning and everything had changed. But after 4 years he has done a lot, and Hillary will continue that progress. Change takes time. Change takes perseverance. We have made tons of progress in the field of equality - women could not VOTE a few decades ago!! Women could not take birth control pills! People were not allowed to be gay! People of color couldn't sit in the front of the bus or even use the same water fountain as white people.. Hillary Clinton and Bill know how to work with asshole Republicans to get bills passed. The House of Representatives is Republican. If you don't work with them, they will block everything. And you have to co-operate you can't just hold a gun to the Republicans head and say ""make college free now or else!"" Because think of it this way: how would you like it if a Republican president could to that? They would be like ""segregation of schools is now law! Birth control and aboriton are now illegal! All gay people and people on welfare will be executed at sunrise!"" We don't have dictatorship in this country. Hillary Clinton has been fighting for women and children and minorities for decades and she knows the players and how to win the chess game that is our political system. It's time for progress. It's time for equal opportunity. It's time to respect women as leaders. #HillaryStrong #ImWithHer A friend recently wrote about Sanders: 
Any man who deliberately remains unemployed until he becomes 40-years-old, for the purpose of not making child support payments to his out-of-wedlock son, should never be considered a potential presidential candidate or nominee. There's an appropriate name for individuals who engage in that despicable act. They're called ""Deadbeat Dads."" Ouch! He is a great rhetorician but he has been in the senate for 20 years and didn't accomplish any miracles yet! How many bills did he pass to protect a woman's right to choose or equality, or to make it easier for people of color to move up in the ranks? Zero. A deadbeat, just like his not working til age 40.

It doesn’t matter which one is more experienced, or which one’s policies are more likely to pass congress, or which one is more likely to win a general election, or which one is a man and which one is a woman.

I believe that person is Bernie. 

If you believe in what Bernie stands for, please chip in a few dollars. We're at a point now where the establishment politics can't brush us off as an impossible movement anymore. They know that Bernie has huge potential, and they're going to do everything they can to try to beat him. 

Thank you, seriously. It means a lot. #FeelTheBern!!

346937065399354_1064717663621287,"HEAD'S UP!!! HERE COMES THE KITCHEN SINK

The Democrat establishment in congress STARTED THIS MORNING MOUNTING A SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST BERNIE! 

California's Feinstein and New York's Schumer led. 

Feinstein's implying there are some ""technical problems"" with Bernies proposals to pay for his programs AND MAKING IT SOUND LIKE HE'S KEEPING IT A 'SECRET.' 

Given Feinstein's long and troubled record, she's got a lot of nerve! 

THESE ARE THE ""LEADERS"" THAT SIT ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE OF THE AISLE-BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE-THEY HAVE ALL SOLD US OUT IN EVERY WAY! 

THESE MEMBERS OF THE STATUS QUO WILL STOOP TO ANYTHING TO SMEAR, DISCREDIT AND DEFEAT BERNIE. 

NOW THEY'RE BETRAYING US BY REFUSING TO ALLOW ""WE, THE PEOPLE"" TO DECIDE WHO WE WANT FOR PRESIDENT! 

THE LIST FOLLOWS. FIND YOUR SENATOR AND THEN SHARE THIS INFO WITH FELLOW BERNIE SUPPORTERS IN YOUR AREA. THEN LAUNCH A PETITION OR LETTER/EMAIL DRIVE TO LET THESE ESTABLISHMENT ""REPRESENTATIVES"" THAT THEIR JOB IS TO REPRESENT US - NOT CLINTON!

I'll also research donor lists for all these people and will share with you in next few days for use in a push back. I'm sure we'll find lots of obvious conflicts. 

BUT WE NEED TO SEND THE MESSAGE NOW THAT WE'RE PUSHING BACK!!

But WE don't need to get ugly - just loud! Personally, I don't appreciate the arrogance of these people who've maintained the status quo - while the people of this country sink further. How DARE THEY REPLACE THEIR OPINION FOR OURS! More oligarchy. 

The list:
Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado -- The Colorado Democrat endorsed Clinton when he agreed to be a top member of her Colorado leadership team.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin --Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut -- Told CNN at a 2014 University of Connecticut event that he ""would support her when and if she"" runs.

""Nearly 15 years ago, Hillary and I were elected to the United States Senate together, and since then I've had the joy and privilege of wishing my friend a happy birthday each year on October 26th. When I called her today, I had the opportunity to deliver a unique birthday message -- that I am proud to endorse her as the next Democratic nominee for President,"" he said.

Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania -- At a 2014 event in Philadelphia, Casey told CNN that it was too early to talk about Clinton 2016. ""I'm not going to get into that,"" he said. But after Clinton announced her run, he emailed supporters to say, ""Having served with her in the Senate, I know she has always been a strong advocate for the middle class and I'm confident she will work tirelessly to ensure that Pennsylvania families have the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.""

Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware --Announced on CNN's ""New Day"" on November 10 that he was backing Clinton, several weeks after Biden announced he wasn't running.

Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana -- Said in a November 13, 2015 statement ""Hoosiers deserve and advocate for middle- and working-class families in their next president.""

Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois -- Headlined a June 2014 fundraiser organized by Ready for Hillary.

Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia -- Headlined a May 2014 fundraiser organized by Ready for Hillary.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota --Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run.

Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont -- Told Vermont Public Radio this in June 2014: ""I told her if she decided to run I would support her and would be willing to do whatever she likes. I've made no secret of that ever since then.""

Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- He told Politico in January 2014 that he wants Clinton to run. ""I don't know if there's anyone more qualified. I've seen it all,"" he said.

Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts --Markey endorsed Clinton in a statement to reporters in October 2015.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island -- Told The Hill in January 2014 that he was backing Clinton.

UNDECIDED
Not all senators, however, are ready to endorse Clinton and some have been unclear about their support. The best example is Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. 

The Nevada lawmaker sent a fundraising email through Ready for Hillary in 2014 and regularly speaks highly of the Clintons. But he has not directly said that he is support her possible run. 

Here is the list of not yet and nos to Clinton 2016:
Sen. Angus King of Maine (Independent who caucuses with Democrats).
Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.
Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada.
Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.

What Bin Laden (shown with National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1979, in pic at left) lost on the battlefield after 9/11 he won on U.S. streets and living-rooms as we traded in our precious civil liberties for the false security of a venal police state devoted to savage capitalism. Tyranny and corporate greed won the day as institutions as disparate as the Republican and Democratic parties, the American Medical Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce took advantage of that climate of fear to advance Wall Street's message of ""unrestricted profit growth by any and all means.""

Why did this happen? When did this happen?

It doesn't really matter. To quote U2: ""You plant a demon seed, you raise a flower of fire.""

That's us. 

Nothing illustrates these painful truths more clearly than the entitled, hateful trash now seeking the presidency in the sordid Reality TV Show our electoral process has become since Citizens United. To look at hate-mongers like Trump and Cruz and Wall Street sellouts like Clinton is to know, without question, that Osama won his showdown with America and the average American lost. Big-time.

346937065399354_1121467981197692,"This Rant destroys the Republican campaign of ""Illegal immigrants are bankrupting America"" and the root of their racism.  Occupy Democrats please share, these numbers are real: 
""Kristen Mulrooney your points are the exact Republican narrative of Fox News, and I applaud you for describing them so clearly and coherently.  The Republican narrative is this: America is a great country.  Illegal immigrants are bankrupting the country.  We should deport all illegal immigrants.  This will somehow solve all of America's problems.  

First let me say that, outside of the horrible racism that occurs in the Republican party, these points deserve to be looked at and considered, as 30% of Americans believe that illegal immigrants are America's problem.  
Let's do the real numbers here, from what you're saying, and see how much is comes to.  That way we can decide if this concern is valid or invalid.  
There are 11.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States according to the current population survey.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigrant_population_of_the_United_States

In 2013, a Republican funded ""group"" called the American Heritage did a study and found that (remember that this study was created by people who hate immigrants when considering their numbers) as of 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household has a net deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of $14,387 per household.[22]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States

  NOW in reality I believe this number is way smaller and was created by a biased group, BUT let's just say this is true and use their possibly distorted high number.  

The average household is recorded as 2.54 PEOPLE. 
http://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/

NOW Let's DO the stone cold math.
11,500,000 illegal immigrants    
divided by 
2.54 people in a household
equals
4,527,559 illegal immigrant HOUSEHOLDS
multiplied by 
$14,387 of tax deficit 
equals
$65,137,992,126 that America is cost
(65 billion dollars)

This entire logic base says that $65 billion a year is ruining America.  This is plainly not true, as we can see how relatively small this figure is.  
The United States Military just spent 1.5 trillion (TRILLION) dollars on a failed fighter jet.
American corporations are stashing 2.1 TRILLION (not billion) dollars overseas which is equal to 
$620,000,000,000 ($620 BILLION) dollars of unpaid taxes.
The Big Bank Bailout cost $7,000,000,000,000 (7 TRILLION Dollars). 

These are just three of the MANY examples where, based on cold hard numbers and facts, the reality is that Illegal immigrants result as less than 1% of a potential tax problem in the United States, while American corporations, Big Banks, and the American military are more than 100 times the cost of illegal immigrants.  

Now we need to  consider the incredible amount of racism that this FALSE ideology has spread throughout America, how many innocent people are being assaulted and murdered because, ignorant as they are, they believe anyone with colored skin is the enemy making their problems.  It really is heart-breaking.

Bernie Sanders is speaking about the real issues facing America, which are the corrupt Big Banks and corporations, and he is going to do something about it.  

I hope my time spent explaining this to you is well received with a mind of reason and consideration.

It's a video I've just completed that I've been meaning to put together for some time now.  And I suspect like-minded friends like you might appreciate it.

Several years ago, I became acquainted with Bud Carter, who had been News Director at WHB in Kansas City, the AM top 40 radio station I grew up listening to.  He was News Director there in 1968 at the time of the MLK assassination and led the station's effort to cover the riots that ensued after the tragic killing.  About ten years ago, Bud gave me this tape recording of a WHB station composite he was asked to produce in 1968 for WHB Sales to demonstrate the station's award-winning news coverage of this developing story to potential advertising clients.  By simply wrapping some old WHB jingles around that composite and adding some images I found on the Kansas City Public Library's awesome website, I now offer this video as a way of preserving this important historical record.  It is with the utmost humility and respect that I share it as a small gift from me to the world in commemoration of Black History Month, 2016.  #BlackLivesMatter

346937065399354_560238634132564,"Hello 
    One of the things that i hate about elections is people get their panties in a bunch over republicans vs democrats, or democrats vs republicans, STOP, your americans 1st and foremost, do whats best for your country, if the best candidate falls into your party of choice then great, awesome, break out the bubbly, but if they dont, then open your eyes to the matrix and still vote for that person, this is our country your talking about, not the party, we cant have bad leadership and expect to flourish as a country.  I am a veteran and not affiliated with any party, i have pride in my country despite what i see happening today, america needs leadership and we need it now more than ever.  I hope all of you are paying attention to whats happening on the outside and realize how close we are to WW3.  One mistake in Syria with Russia and that will happen, and how many of you feel confident with the competency of the leadership we have today?  Putin, Iran, China, North Korea, ISIS, they all think we're growing 'soft' - and being a vet this hurts me to admit but i agree with them, we have grown soft, our military is tired of fighting these bs conflcts with no end in sight, why are we there?  Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Syria, have we really helped any of them to become a better place or have we just made matters worse?  How did we allow Benghazi to happen?  13 hours those brave americans held out and all we could send them was a handful of security from Tripoli and a UNARMED DRONE????  I call bs, i can drive halfway across OUR country in 13 hours so do not tell me we couldnt get help to Benghazi within a few hours, UNARMED DRONE? Mind boggling, nice recruitment post for the State Dept, we'll send you to a hostile foreign land with below minimum security, sound good?  I have some cheap swamp land for sale if u think that does, lol.  Another subject I want to talk about while I have a captive audience being dazzle by me, is Mefloquine (Lariam) the anti-malaria pill that our military gave to over 100k soldiers from 1990 to about 2010, the pill that is being called the military suicide pill or the Agent Orange of our generation, the VA now reports that we're losing 22 veterans per day to suicide, thats not acceptable, we dont have the research to prove the connection to Lariam, but its strongly being considered to being suspect #1, I am trying to get Congress and Roche to investigate, we're losing too good people, good people that are suffering silently, good people that have went overseas to do their patriotic duty.  I hope you will read my petition, if you agree please sign and share it, we need to make the public aware of whats happening and whats not happening at this point, if we wait 20+ years like we did with Agent Orange then thousands of lives will have be wasted.  Scary thing is this pill was the #1 anti-malaria pill for years, and millions of people have taken it, I hope I am wrong about it but the more I learn the more it scares me, I hope it scares you too, enough that you join the petition and spread the word, this is a potential global epidemic on a massive scale.  

Thank you 　 
Jerry Weaver

http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/full-interview-hillary-clinton-february-7/

Check out this link, about 1/3 of the way through the interview, speaking on late-term abortion and Roe v Wade. This is what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said:

""That's why this has to be taken into account by each individual woman, by her physician and her family.""

Her family??!! Where does Roe v Wade require a family be brought into a decision? This very concerning. What she stated is more restricting than Roe v Wade.

Roe v Wade is about a woman having reproductive control over her own body. If she chooses to bring her family into the decision, that's her business - not her family's and certainly not the business of elected officials. Can you imagine having to make what is most certainly a very difficult decision and being REQUIRED to bring a family member into the decision?

What the hell, Hillary?

Is Clinton supportive of a woman's right to make decisions about her body, or not? According to her this past Sunday, not so much.","Full interview: Hillary Clinton, February 7",link,http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/full-interview-hillary-clinton-february-7/,2016-02-08 23:12:58,0,0,0

1. “Hillary Says She’s Not an “Establishment” Candidate—Because She’s a Woman [Running For President]” – Slate.com headline.  This is an easy one.  Two other women have run for president, one in 2012 and one this year: Michele Bachmann and Carly Fiorina, two female bastions of non-establishment political presidential candidates if I ever saw one.  Ok, that Hillary fib has been dispensed with. 

2. “Hillary Clinton: Single-payer health care will ""never, ever"" happen” – CBS News online article.  This is what she is saying: Although she would be a progressive president ready to go, the Congress she will be working with will always, always be a Conservative/GOP-controlled Congress that will never, never enact a national single-payer health care system. She is admitting that although she would be a progressive president if elected, her coattails would not be long enough to a multitude of progressive Democratic politicians into Congress to pass progressive legislation. She’s announcing defeat before the battle has been started. She believes that improving and expanding the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare—which had its genesis in the Koch-owned Heritage Foundation back in the ‘70s—is the only “progressive” way to go—and remember, she’s ready to go! Despite all her progressive talk she continues to think traditionally and regressive, that real progressive politics will never work or ever come about in the United States.  And she intends to remain in the forefront keeping a national single-payer health care system from ever progressing forward and being enacted into law.

Did you know that for every $10,000 you earn each year, $7.36 of it helps to feed those in need of food?  Percentage wise, that is 0.074% … 74/1000ths of one percent!

In the mean time, of that $10,000, $800 or EIGHT PECENT, or 108 times greater an amount, helps to provide tax breaks to corporations that end up moving jobs to other countries and, in many cases, pay no tax and get supplemented by the government!

Main Street Philosopher is a collection of essays based on Bill Peach’s fifty-two years (1951-2003) of experience as a merchant and men’s clothier on Main Street in Historic Franklin Tennessee. The “philosopher” shares stories of Main Street as it was in the 1950s and the changes that came. With a life view gained from a mid-twentieth-century upbringing in a country hollow and a small town, he writes on matters of religion and education from a philosophical and political slant.",,status,,2016-02-08 08:00:39,0,0,0

346937065399354_1062942147132172,"SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY:  --While Rubio's blunders have probably cost him the GOP nomination this week (see the on-line articles on RobotRubio and his mechanical repetitions, and out of context, of set campaign talking points, a strange sight to have seen last Friday), Mrs. Clinton's are those of Cognitive Distortions triggering errors in judgement in part as in her sense of Entitlement, one such distortion.  Her sense of entitlement includes her view of herself as paying the price through service to the country on issues such as medical care for citizens and, oddly, on her being a woman, as if that entitles anyone to any thing.  The major Feminists of the past would consider her a strange associate in the struggle for liberty and social justice on a number of fronts.
--  Progressives are less than enthusiastic about her;  as one associate notes, he strikes one as ""a 1974 Republican"" (which is no doubt better than being an anti-science contemporary Republican).  ----Sanders in contrast is a FDR New Deal Democrat, as Chomsky notes, as viewed by political developments within the U.S.    --- Sanders seems freer of the cognitive distortion and logical fallacy of Either-Or thinking.  He does not have a list of political enemies or record of engaging in overstatements in order to score points for his team or himself. In thinking internationally he is less limited by the fallacy of Ethnocentrism, that we are the center of what is good and true in religion, a speciality of the GOP now. 
--It might be proposed that this election will not be so much about foreign policy, or how hawkish a candidate is, but about social issues in this country, finally, including what Warren and Sanders refer to as the rigging of the economy.  Here Clinton seems tone deaf, and younger voters, thinking past the new election, see their futures under a perpetual threat from a system paying to protect the few while the many suffer economically.  Being hawkish is not a central virtue to those wishing to apply critical thinking and long-term thinking about social and economic problems, and her Sanders is the more appealing to those under thirty with college educations in particular.

This is a great move by the DNC to once again take the White House. A 2011 report by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that over the previous two decades of U.S. elections, Donald Trump made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top 10 recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, seems to think there’s a possibility. Bush Tweeted; “Maybe Donald negotiated a deal with his buddy Hillary Clinton,” “Continuing this path will put her in the White House.” George Will had this to say on the subject; “If Donald Trump were a Democratic mole placed in the Republican Party to disrupt things, how would his behavior be any different?”, “I don’t think it would be.” Trump is also very friendly with Bill and Hillary, so much so that the Clintons were at Trumps wedding.

I was a Hillary supporter.  I didn't like Bernie either.  Thought he looked like a wild scientist more than presidential.  My daughters are in college and have never cared about politics.  All of a sudden I heard them having in depth political conversation about the direction this country is going.  They didn't pic him cause he has style or because he's cool.  They want him because they are tired of the wars their generation is fighting.  They're afraid of the Next War having a draft. They believe in his message.  Having been in military conflicts. w 7th Special Forces trainig Contras in Nicaragua I can empathize.  I agree wall stret is rigged. I agree banks need to be broke up the way Republican President. Teddy Rosevelt did with the first anti trust laws to break up momopolies.
I think we need a masive shake up in DC and wall street.  We need Campaign Finance reform to remove ""McCain/Feingold"" and ""Citizens United.""  I see Hillary as too close to the problem to be able to fix it.  I have trust issues.  Why wont she release the transcipts to all the speaches she gave to the banks??  Cause they love her and she thinks the banks have been midunderstood. She has Super Pacs and big$ banks financing her camoaign.  He has only individual campaign donors averaging $27.00 each.

I was a Hillary supporter.  I didn't like Bernie.  Thought he looked like a wild scientist more than presidential.  My daughters are in college and have never cared about politics.  All of a sudden I heard them having in depth political conversation about the direction this country is going.  They didn't pic him cause he has style or because he's cool.  They want him because they are tired of the wars their generation is fighting.  They're afraid of the Next War having a draft. They believe in his message.  Having been in military conflicts. w 7th Special Forces trainig Contras in Nicaragua I can empathize.  I agree wall stret is rigged. I agree banks need to be broke up the way Republican President. Teddy Rosevelt did with the first anti trust laws to break up momopolies.
I think we need a masive shake up in DC and wall street.  We need Campaign Finance reform to remove ""McCain/Feingold"" and ""Citizens United.""  I see Hillary as too close to the problem to be able to fix it.  I have trust issues.  Why wont she release the transcipts to all the speaches she gave to the banks??  Cause they love her and she thinks the banks have been midunderstood. She has Super Pacs and big$ banks financing her camoaign.  He has only individual campaign donors averaging $27.00 each.  And he's pulling in as much as her.  He has experience of 30 yrs fom Mayor to Congress to the Senate.  He knows his way around.  This election means alot to everyone.

Perhaps it's a Jewish thing for some of Bernie's fans and supporters. Perhaps Bernie simply is taking advantage of support from mostly young and/or unaware people who really do not understand the give & take compromises that are needed in the complex realm of USA and global politics.

Remember,  united we stand,  Divided we fall.  The answer has been right in our faces the whole time we have just been to busy hating for no rhyme or reason to long to see it.  Learn to judge an individual for his actions and not a group for one's evil deeds.  We are all connected from the ground we walk on to the plants, animals, and insects.  All energy of the universe is connected!
we must fight for liberty and freedom. Fillings and emotions are energy that releases a vibration we are sensitive to and feed off of and soak like a spunge. Never let anyone say you're wrong for demanding your Constitutional rights. To become the most human humanly possible we must follow our desire to live outside the borders of our minds. We must be one with nature and know in order for there to be balance we must give as much as we receive. Love thy neighbor, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, protect the young and elderly.  Always protect the innocent of harm regardless of color, religion or politics. We are human beings that happen to have different colors.  Harm none, spread life always and only defend yourself and those who can't defend themselves on their own from bodily harm. May God bring us all peace in mind in doing the right thing. Unity is a beautiful place to start.  Beam your beauty from within and be part of creating a beautiful nation!  Worldwide is next, we must all take that first step. One person at a time, any progress is good progress which will become complete success! The first step to true unity is standing together as one, UNITED we STAND, divided we fall.

346937065399354_785298218259945,"Tell  Hillary Clinton to stop lying about her Iraq vote

On Wednesday night's CNN town hall, Hillary Clinton falsely claimed that her vote for the 2003 Iraq invasion had actually been a vote for more inspections rather than war.

Enough is enough! Click here to tell her to stop lying! 
http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11984

In fact, Clinton voted against an amendment proposed by Senator Carl Levin that would have authorized war only if Iraq refused to fully cooperate with UN inspectors.

""Instead,"" notes scholar Stephen Zunes, ""she voted for the Republican-sponsored resolution which gave President Bush the authority to invade and occupy Iraq at the time and circumstances of his own choosing.""

In fact, Clinton at the time justified her vote by parroting Bush and Cheney's false claims about biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, and Iraqi ties to al Qaeda -- war propaganda rejected at the time by many experts around the world.

This is the crux of Senator Cruz's premise and his argument regarding his ""natural born citizen"" status. It is wholly dependent on his mother's American citizenship regardless of his birth place, his father's citizenship and the reason the family was in Canada at the time of Senator Cruz's birth. I have heard the various Harvard Constitutional Law professors and their reasoning regarding the meaning of the term ""natural born"" as defined in English Common Law and believe it to be sufficient to put the matter to rest. But I think there is another aspect no one has addressed and it concerns the premise of the argument that citizenship is granted via perpetuity because one parent is a citizen. Let's pretend Ted Cruz never left Canada. Let's pretend he grew up there, met a nice Canadian girl and had a child. Under Senator Cruz's premise his child would also be a natural born citizen of the United States as the child would have one parent that was a natural born citizen of the U.S. (Ted Cruz) In our make believe scenario let's pretend Ted Cruz's child also never leaves Canada and grows up and marries a nice Canadian girl and they have a child. Under Senator's Cruz's premise for his argument, would that child, Ted Cruz's grandchild, not also be considered a natural born citizen of the U.S.? Here we are, three generations of the Cruz family all having been born in Canada, all having lived in Canada and all having never set foot in the U.S. and yet according to Senator Ted Cruz's premise all would be natural born citizens of the U.S. as they all had at least one parent who would be considered as a natural born citizen of the U. S. and therefore all would be eligible to be President of the United States.

346937065399354_10201479062453976,"WHEN I GET OLDER

 My name is Anthony. I’m two years old in this picture. I like to ride my big wheel, chase birds and run around in stores and hide and watch my mother lose her mind. It’s fun! I like when we go for a drive in the car and I get to tell my parents which way to turn because I have a very good sense of direction. I like cookies and candy and snacks. I have two stomachs, a food stomach and a snack stomach. My food stomach gets full quickly but my snack stomach never does. My parents don’t believe this, but they’re just stupid heads. 

 I’m older now and I want to make some friends. The kids my mom tries to hook me up with want to play with my computer (it’s really my Dad’s computer but he lets me use it) and swim in my parent’s pool, but they don’t really want to be my friends. I don’t know why. Maybe there is something wrong with me, or maybe those kids are just stupid heads. 

 I’m in middle school now and I’m going to find some friends on my own. There are some kids who smoke pot and want me to smoke pot too and be their friends. I promised my Mom I would never do drugs. Drugs are bad for you. But pot is not a drug. It’s an herb and it’s all natural, and these kids who smoke it are not stupid heads. And they want to be my friend.

 In high school I meet some new kids who might be my friends. They are all taking pain pills so I will take pain pills too so they won’t think I’m weird. They are just pills, right? They come from a doctor just like the pink stuff my mom used to give me when I was a baby and had an earache. Taking pain pills won’t hurt me and it will get me lots of new friends.

 These pain pills make me feel good and l don’t have to think about whether my friends really like me or just want to hang around me because I know where to get pot and pain pills. But boy have those pills gotten expensive.

 I’m in college now and those pain pills I need haven’t gotten any cheaper. OK, I have to take more pills then I used to, but still, it’s hard to come up with $180 every time I have to take my pills. I don’t like stealing from my family and I don’t like selling stuff on e-Bay that my friends steal and pretending to myself that I don’t know that it’s stolen, but I’ve got to have those pills.

 But there is another way. I hate needles, but Heroin is so damn cheap I guess I’m going to have to get used to them. It’s not so bad. After the first couple of times it was easy. And the heroin works even better than the pills, and OK, I shoot heroin, but I’m not an addict or anything.

 Oh my God, what a loser I am! I am a heroin addict. I’m doing it almost every day and I can’t stop. My younger self would call me a “stupid head” and he’d be right.

 The past six years have been tough. I get clean, then I relapse. Then I get clean, then I relapse. I’m in rehab again. It’s my third time and I know the drill so I know my time here is almost up. Insurance will only pay for so much time because they consider addicts losers and a waste and they try to cut you off as fast as they can. Three weeks is not enough time to learn how to deal with the cravings and all the triggers to use, but I’m really going to try to stay clean when I leave this time.

 Things are finally starting to come together for me. I still have a year to go at Penn State but I’m not sure I’m going to go back. I got a job as a salesman selling high quality food and related products and I’m really good at it. I’m also making bank. I’m saving up to get my own place and I’m thinking about maybe moving to Cali. I’m hanging around with my little brother Nick more. He’s actually pretty cool. I’m helping my Mudder by cooking diner for the fam when she works. I just got my boxer puppy from a breeder in Oklahoma. I’m calling him Caesar. He is so cute and I’m going to train him to listen to me. My best bud, Phil, is coming over tonight and we’re going to hit some bars, maybe check out a party. My legal troubles are all straightened out. My probation officer came by earlier today and drug tested me. I don’t get tested again for another week so I’m thinking maybe just one more time.

 My friend Nicole stopped by to see me today. She was at my funeral and now she’s dead too from heroin. There’s no time here in heaven, but Nicole said it’s been about a year since I died. She said my parents have become advocates for addicts and for removing the stigma of addiction and for improving addiction treatment. I think that’s a good thing. 

 She said my Dad is trying to get the insurance companies or the government to pay for longer treatment, at least ninety (90) days. I think that would help a lot of people. She said he wants to name it after me and that he started this petition on MoveOn.org http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/anthonys-act… and he wants to get as people as he can to sign and help get more people to sign by sharing it on Facebook and Twitter and by e-mailing all their friends. If I were still alive I would definitely sign it and I hope you will sign it and share it and tell all your friends to sign it and share it too.

 I have all the time in the world now and I can wait to see all my friends who do drugs. I want them to live a long, full life before we meet again. Let’s give them a real chance at recovery.

If we don't do this, nothing will really CHANGE.. our corrupted U.S.Congress will go on Preventing positive changes..

We need Millions of people to sign on in order to force this into the National Discussion.. once there, it will be a constant reminder of WHERE our problems are coming from and what WE think should be done about it. Please Ask ALL of your email friends and contacts to have a look at it?

I admit I am a geek, I watch Star Trek and dream, hope, maybe even pray that someday we will have a world without war, without hunger, or homelessness, without greed or poverty.  This may be naive, it may be an impossible dream, but it is my hope for my kids, your kids, for our small blue dot and our human race.  

For the first time I see a man pointing us in the right direction, a leader who is fighting for every single one of us, for our planet our humanity, for every living soul here today and to follow tomorrow.

With tears in my eyes I hope.  With tears in my eyes I fear.  With tears in my eyes I watch our future unfold.  I believe that we may be at a turning point for mankind.  I believe that we will soon make a choice between compassion, love, integrity, hope, and universal prosperity versus greed, hate, divisiveness and darkness.

I am scared, scared for this man, scared for my two sons, scared for our humanity and future.  It is up to me and every man, woman, and child to stand up, stand together and choose our future, choose the positive path.  It will be hard work, we will have powerful enemies, there will be pain, but we have everything to gain and nothing to loose.  We hold the future of humanity in our hands.

Embrace the hope, share your tears, take this chance and trust this man and those who will follow.  Stand up, be counted, be heard, be seen, be positive, fight the good fight, and do the work.  

The time is now....Give Bernie Sanders your trust, your hope, your vote, and your promise to help him fight this fight.

Bernie Sanders - he may be our only hope, don't let this opportunity pass us by.

Vote, Support, and Trust - Bernie Sanders for President!!!

IMPROVED TRANSLATION.
Illuminati's ultimate dream.
(Has George Orwell's '1984' become reality?)
In the Middle East, a dreadful war has been raging for decades, a perpetual concluct where chaos reigns and where many parties are active. As almost all of these have hidden agendas, war is getting more intense and confusing, pushing the possibility of a long-lasting peace further and further away.
In the past few years, it has become clear that the war in Iraq was orchestrated by Bush Jr. and associates (Blair and Cheney have publicly admitted that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq), making it an illegal war, and those responsible should face an American court. That Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator is another question, as there are a lot of those running around.
There were other reasons which I cannot elaborate on, but what I would like to mention is that President George Bush mostly seemed to protect the oil fields, and not the population. After the war ended, America and their Western Allies left the Iraqis to their fate and did nothing, or too little, for the senior officers (now IS leaders) and old soldiers, who had important positions in Saddam Hussein's regime, which were now unemployed, thus leading the way for IS.
However, the real perpetrators of all misery still evade scrutiny: the shadow government, the 1%, Rothschild and his gang, where greed power is idolized in EXTREME. Megalomaniac people who probably also think that they are chosen by God. STOP THE SELFISHNESS OF GREED.
Now there are millions of war refugees adrift in Europe. By my knowledge, only Canada and Europe adopt refugees. Why not America, or the surrounding rich Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia (which has an empty tent camp for pilgrims where one million people can be accommodated), Kuwait, Qatar?
We need to help war refugees, that's normal and also our human duty, but opening our borders also means letting in many economic refugees, mostly young men, oldest sons of disadvantaged families with little education, and also somewhat spoiled by their status. With much testosterone in their blood and little respect for Western society, those individuals cause trouble for the well-meaning Muslims.
Also, radical imams are using inflammatory language and call their followers to rise against the free world, with the intent to Islamize Europe. The majority of Muslims are peace-loving and just want to escape violence and war. Judge man/woman for what he/she does and not what he / she believes or what colour he/she has.
Unfortunately in Europe, values fade away and degradation increases. The frustrated citizen take it out on minorities, refugees, politics, everything and everyone, afraid for their jobs, afraid for their future, causing fear and hatred. A survival mechanism based on fear, ignorance, intolerance. Understandable because ordinary human being abandoned by their governments, which are governed again by the true leaders of the world elite.
Greed is the greatest threat. “The offshore industry is a major threat for our democratic institutions and our basic social contract,” says French economist Thomas Piketty, author of Capital in the Twenty-First Century. “Financial opacity is one of the key drivers of rising global inequality. It allows a large fraction of top income and top wealth groups to pay negligible tax rates, while the rest of us pay large taxes in order to finance the public goods and services (education, health, infrastructures) that are indispensable for the development process.”
In Europe, problems have already started, a prelude to what's coming. By division, incitement, polarization, populism, disrespect for free values, testosterone-supporting young North African men, who steal, assault and rape, (but again nuance, not generalize) are groups opposed. Chaos, anarchy and violence everywhere as the right of the strongest take over the streets of Europe.
Again Europe is burning and remains in complete anarchy, confused, hungry. If America steps in to ""save"" Europe, with their shadow government, most Europeans will be grateful and willing to adhere to the world elite and their demands. These are, among others: One World Leader, One Religion (their Religion), a total state control, with chips inplant. There will be no freedom, no democracy. If you do not comply, you will be locked up in large factory-prisons, free roof, eat, work. Those opposing the state are classified as a terrorist and get killed.
All extremism is reprehensible and must be stopped. It is time for global resistance, a peaceful movement, where love reigns and where leaders really lead and not let the people suffer, as always happened in the past. The eternal deception most stop.
Holy books are abused (in the early days and still) in favor of the powerfull people in charge and therefore the real truths are taken away and twisted. And in lies and deception there is no truth. It is time for transparency, truth and justice. It is time that the economy is at the service of humanity and not the other way around.
We are only travelers and mortals and its our Sacred Duty and moral obligation to protect Mother Earth and our Children and Grandchildren and leave behind a secure loving planet.

This is in part from an interest in politics and partly from an awareness of the effect your countries politics has on the world.  Anyway while the usa luke most countries gets a lot wrong you should remember you get a lot right...     you do have your share of biggots and those who seem uncaring towards the poor. However while you didnt think uo democracy.  You do it well and while you didnt think up free speech you also do that  well  ......you were the first to make it a priority and although free speech is misused by many for hate. It is also what has protected minoritygroups seeking to ket the masses know of their plight. Free s p eech is why biggoted views ate less accepted anywhere these days and I think the usa can takw the credit for that.  So while I am gkad to see people trying to improve the situation for many in your country I do think you can still be proud of your country... Btw I am proud of mine for other reasons.

346937065399354_1059333144159739,"Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist. I know that word is scary for some. I'm sorry that it's hard to understand for some folks. I have spent my life with a wall up where politics are concerned. I have always listened to these people and had a deep feeling that it's all about business and business that is geared to line their pockets. I've also been a nurse for a while now, and that profession affords me the ability to read people and make a very solid assessment of their personality, physical and mental status. When I started to listen to Bernie, I was at first justbtaking it in, but then I realized through assessment, that this guy is genuine, he is compassionate and passionate. He doesn't care about money. He cares deeply about this country and the people that are in it. He wants nothing from anyone. He wants to truly lead people to a better life. A better economy. He wants the equality that our country is supposed to be about. Let me ask folks, if you see someone suffering, but trying to make it in any way they can but they keep falling...someone that you love and care for, do you turn the other way, keep your greed and watch them suffer? If you do, that's not part of humanity. I understand that there are charlatans out there and you have to be careful but we also have to be a part of our community. Know what I see all the time. Community programs like churches or organizations that will shun folks because they don't dress properly or don't have the things that people with more wealth have but most of all they don't agree with the dogma.They look down on these folks. These are human beings. You have no idea how they grew up or where they can from or what hell they've been through. What I think is that God will judge us on how we look away when we can help lift folks up. Just like someone who comes in sick and even on their death bed from a gunshot wound or an overdose, do you let them suffer or do you do whatever you can to help them? None of us are any better than the other. We are brothers and sisters and love is within us. Greed is not love. Everyone should be doing what they can to help each other. Nationwide. Worldwide. Love has to be the foundation that we build this fucked up place on now and forever if we are going to have a fighting chance. Put away the greed. Lay down your hands and your hearts for your fellow man. No matter how small.

And realize that Bernie is the only candidate now and probably that will ever come along to do this. Join the revolution. Start by loving your neighbors no matter what.

346937065399354_1059262750833445,"HRC and her campaign didn't walk away with Iowa. In realpolitik, that's a LOSS for her because Bernie jumped more than 30% while her support dropped almost the same amount.

Hillary has been a world figure and part of the political system for more than 40 years, and she ran for pres before. The Clinton machine that was formed and carried Bill into the presidency has only grown stronger during those years. 

Last summer, virtually NO ONE in this country had ever even heard of Bernie. His crowds, the record small donations, the grassroots support, and his honest and forthright approach and standing on his principles rocketed him to matching Clinton last night in the caucuses. The coin flip luck for her is a very small consolation for a woman who was sure she'd sweep Iowa back when she declared. 

All the media's declaration of her as the ""winner"" is just their ongoing propaganda machine. And there was absolutely no way she could have done anything other than call it a ""win."" She, the DNC, the Dem establishment and the media are invested in a ""status quo"" political system that THEY HAVE CREATED over the last 4 decades. Given their investment, they're going to bald face lie, skew numbers, revise the English language (""virtual tie"" now means win"") and anything else they have to in order to sustain the status quo. 

Campaigns are psychological - and she dare not admit to the truth here. That's also why she and the aforementioned players are avoiding the truth as much as possible. Unfortunately for them, for literally THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS - the citizens of our country refuse to be treated as mushrooms who ""go along to get along."" We're fed up and taking on one of the most massive status quo systems in history.

AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT ALL US REVOLUTIONARIES NEED TO KEEP IN MIND: the status quo system that the various entities are protecting is based on BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 

The establishment set up a system to serve themselves, and they're going to have to be turned on their heads for us to succeed. 

The most glaring example of this is reflected in the fact that in these decades, APPROXIMATELY 97% OF OUR CONGRESS HAVE DONE WHAT HILLARY HAS - BECOME MEMBERS OF THE .01% OF THE WEALTHIEST IN OUR NATION. 

If you check, that is 180 degrees from where it was even 30 years ago. Back then, they were ""public servants"" whose salaries often forced a penurious life style in D.C. That's no longer the case. In no small part thanks to Bill Clinton who defeated Glass Steagell, passed NAFTA, privatized student loans and helped engineer  a watershed change in our country, where small business was the engine of our economy. Because of the major changes for Wall Street, they were slowly suffocated, with Wall Street and the financial sector taking over.

So the status quo are now being forced to face a brutal reality: IT WILL ALL GO AWAY IF BERNIE IS ELECTED AND THE REVOLUTION REMOVES THE ""PAID FOR"" FROM THE LOCAL LEVELS ON UP. AND THAT'S BILLIONS & BILLIONS. On many levels. 

So of course they lie. So we'll just keep on! 

On a final note, the Dem caucus is true democracy at work. The PEOPLE join together to discuss the candidates and try to sway others. The system is pure 50/50 - an objective measure. No ""super majorities"" or ""super delegates"" - just regular Americans voting. And in the end, a coin toss is an objective decision maker, not subjective. So it's a clean and honest process. Interesting how lucky she was? Yes. Meaningful? Absolutely. BECAUSE THE RESULT WASNT BASED ON SUPPORT, but a random methodology. 

In a matter of months, Bernie Sanders has achieved an equal standing with her, despite the Dem leadership & establishment, and the glaringly obvious media that's done everything to polish her star and push her forward, - even to the point of outright lying. Yet Bernies Revolution is rocketing, despite everything. 

THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TRULY INTERNET-DRIVEN CAMPAIGN EVER. If someone lies or misstates a position, millions immediately research it and then immediately debunk it if it's a lie. Then they immediately spread the truth thru social media so that if someone lies, or ""shades"" the truth, they get called out on it within a few minutes.

Look at what happened to poor Chelsea; she spewed the falsehoods HRC's campaign fed her and was roundly criticized for it. - not in days or weeks, but IMMEDIATELY!

BEING FORCED TO ADDRESS THE TRUTH IS A WHOLE NEW PROCESS THATS NEVER BEEN A CAMPAIGN FACTOR BEFORE. This, my fellow revolutionaries, is exactly what HRC and the Dem establishment are missing. In an Internet world, campaigns will no longer be prosecuted with smoke and mirrors - but with the 99% learning, educating themselves and participating. The young especially are unforgiving of lies. 

As I've said before, the truth is unforgiving. HRC, the Dem machine and the establishment are in a desperate situation, no matter how much spin it.",,status,,2016-02-02 18:39:18,0,0,0

346937065399354_1059134824179571,"Given the ""irregularities"" on display in this most archaic of political contests I'd call this an impressive win for Bernie Sanders.
Here's why:
Bernie acheved a statistical tie in a contest where the pundits were expecting him to be soundly defeated.
The Media blackout is over. While equal time in the corporate media is not gonna happen, Bernie's hit the radar and he's clearly not going away.
While we're on the subject of media, the Clinton campaign's desperation and underhanded tactics were on full display as C Span and cell phone video was there to document it in all it's flaming glory.
An inexperienced grass roots campaign funded by nickels and dimes and manned by volunteers put together a ground game that effectively neutralized the best the Democratic National Committee had to offer, and they did it in a few short months while the Clinton campaign has been on the ground since 2014.
If you thought Bernie Sanders's supporters were fired up before.....

Bernie was in the low teens just a few months ago, while HRC was riding high. Bernie came up more than 30 points while HRC dropped dramatically. That's HUGE! 

Now they split the delegates almost evenly, based on a 701-697 vote. HRC gets 22 - Bernie 21. And three caucuses had to flip a coin to declare a winner! 

When you compare the fact that she's been in the media constantly for close to 40 years and a huge political player on the world stage - and Bernie was virtually unknown - she was not the victor, no matter how the media spins it.

Written in the style of an investigative reporter, this 290-page book is simply one of the most exhaustive, comprehensive books about the growing “Occupy Wall St.” and “We Are The 99%” movements written so far. It offers the clearest explanation to date about what these movements are trying to accomplish and what they stand for, and it vilifies the extreme economic hardship and what the author calls “enforced austerity” of millions of formerly middle class Americans. This is the definitive book on the state of American political dissent in the early 21st century, and it ends with a prediction of mass civil unrest in the US and other capitalist countries due to the extreme concentration of wealth in favor of the top 1%. Was $12.95, reduced to $8.95 with free shipping, tax deductible too! Get yours at www.pcmatl.org/books-and-donations, or on Amazon (cost is higher), or get the e-book on Payhip at https://payhip.com/b/CV5h,  Goodreads.com, Kindle and Nook for only $3.50!

Also you need inverter, the opposite of rectifier, to convert direct current from the baterries to 220 volts alternating current. By this principle, it is possible to harness the wave of the sea as a source of clean energy. With our incoming President Bernie Sanders, these projects would be a paramount importance or priority.
