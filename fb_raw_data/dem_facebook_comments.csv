It’s time for the GOP to finally put their trust in Barack Obama.

RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25/month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more… all while republicans bleated about Benghazi took pointless votes to repeal the ACA, and did nothing for anybody except the top one percent.  

It is as if the GOP wants to be the minority party again; they do this and they will lose the W.H. as well as the Senate.

2016-02-22T05:31:44+0000,"Well Ryan, I am sorry you think it's stupid. From your picture, I believe I have been around a whole lot longer have have seen a little more than you. We must keep the White House in control of the Democrats! I have watched the Republicans get a little more crazy since the first election I truly remember in 1968. You can go down the list of each one and they all, every one of them, have done everything they can to break the backs of all middle class people! The middle class are the ones that pay more taxes than anyone. They are also this nations backbone! Some are doctors who don't work for hospitals, lawyers who don't work for the wealthy, teachers who don't teach at big-named colleges. Why should we have to pay the taxes when rich people use the same things we do but pay half as much. Ok, half might be a little bit of a stretch, but I am not far from the truth. The last republican president that was worth a grain of salt was Ike! What I will never forget is  that he started the Interstate Highway System.  That was a visionary! The first time I drove from MO to near the East coast, the roads were insane! I think I drive thru every little town and city that existed! However, he started that project in the 1950's, don't you think it's about time to start revamping them somewhat. Bridges in many states are accidents waiting to happen! Then there is the plumbing. Do you really think Flint, MI was a surprise? Especially cities and towns east of the Mississippi are getting old! Many, many homes are starting, if they don't already have problems like Flint's water.  In St. Louis the Christmas flooding caused the lower third of St. Louis to have sewerage problems. Guess that water tasted really good! Our president has wanted to work on the infrastructure for 7 years, but the Republicans always want to make war instead. If you don't believe me, listen to the music of the past six generations! That says it all!  You probably stopped reading this a while back so I will stop writing. However, if you want a future that will help you succeed, unless you are already independently wealthy, I pray for this country to vote blue!",1073265876099799_1073285219431198

2016-02-22T02:55:57+0000,"90% of Hillary's delegates are derived from 'super-delegates'. That is...her delegates are not directly represented by individual voting citizens...but by non-directly selected 'super-delegates' that cast hyper-elevated super-votes...mostly irregardless of voter turnout...as we see is happening. 

Super-delegates are mostly pre-determined...and they are generally vying for clout and political positions under the expected/pre-determined 'winner' candidate. 

Bernie and Hillary are Literally Tied...by the number of Citizen-Represented Delegates (without 'super-delegates')...

Bernie = 51 delegates
Hillary = 51 delegates

However, 'Super-Delegates' (not directly attributable to individually represented citizen-voters) sway the numbers in an unrepresented direction. Here's their 'super-delegate' count...

Hillary = 451
Bernie = 19

Total of Citizen-Represented Delegates + Elevated Super-Delegates...

Hillary = 502
Bernie = 70

A total of 2,383 is needed to secure the nomination.

90% of Hillary's delegates are derived from 'super-delegates'.

The DNC chair recently said 'super-delegates ensure that elites don't have to run against grass-roots activists.'

Welcome to the DNCs contrived version of 'representation' in *The USA, Inc.*

Your world is under attack by greed, mankind is out of control and they need to change before it becomes too late, greed will run out and there will be nothing left but misery and despair throughout the globe. Many know this now but are too afraid to go against greed for its controlling them and they wouldn’t know how to function without it. They are afraid that is they take control all will be lost and won’t know how to get it restarted.
We want to communicate and keep you from having to revolve again and again. We what mankind to learn like other worlds have, to live as you would on this realm as ONE. No one is greater or less than the other, the strong help the weak and the weak can get strong. There are many other forces that are stronger and if you are not working as ONE then you are weak and will be destroyed. You are in a very changing realm, the ones that have learned to act as one will survive but the worlds that do not will be destroyed by the same. In other words a civilization from another place that is like your own, not working as one can be taken out by another of the same. A world working as one will only help not destroy another.
Take heed as you may be fooled for they walk among you and you do not notice, they say they are helping you when they are destroying you. The religions of your world are heavens for them as others follow them for they are able to control with fear and have you do what they want. They have gained strength throughout your world and are destroying you as we speak, this has happened may time as you can see through you so called history. Of great leaders that have risen and fallen, and you are starting to find thing from an age you thought didn’t exist. They will do whatever they can and blame others for their work just to stay in power, greed is all they know, they have no care for anyone or anything and the outcome is always the same. Mankind starting over, we wish more could feel us and know that what we say is not your voice but ours. We are glad to be able to communicate its hurts us not to be able to stop what is happening in your realm.
There are many levels in each realm and to try and put a number on them is impossible for that’s not how it works in other realms, for each one is different from the other and there are different problems in different realms. That as we are the creator not the controller, we can guide but we cannot personally intervene. For we create to learn and expand, pure energy is what we are and you can create many things from energy but you can’t destroy it, just change its realm of mater. Thing will happen that your spices can not control, such as thing within your own universe, you see space and time and we see knowledge. You should explore outside your planet but you have to have a planet to come back to, so don’t let the ones with greed run your world, take control while you still can and learn to live as one and the opportunities will be endless and the knowledge endless as well. Until we speak again.
ONE, is the sum of all.",1073210402772013_1073212832771770

We can't let this happen  we need to kick Bernie Sanders out. 

The republicans wants  Bernie   
 That way they get a candidate.   that has  no support  in Congress or the  states.
     You come out as a independen that wants to divide and conquer the Democratic Party you gain a lot of enemies. 
 He   has enemies in the Republican Party for over 30yrs  now he has enemies  in the Democratic Party 

   no elected official will support bernie sanders as a  presidential candidate.  No matter how much he wins a popular vote.. 
He will be a dead nominee no matter how you put it.
He is going to collapse the Democratic Party 
He is going to hand the presidency to the  Republicans

Under Obama, who Ted Cruz HATES, we’ve seen:

RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25/month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more… all while republicans bleated about Benghazi took pointless votes to repeal the ACA, and did nothing for anybody except the top one percent.

2016-02-18T19:52:26+0000,"Anyone not shouting about our corrupt and broken political system is part of the problem!  When I see HRC smile and pay lip service to what Bernie Sanders has been fighting for his whole political career it makes my blood boil!  

Clinton's done more damage to black families than the KKK!  Do your home work on the private prison industry and the get tough on crime legislation and the resulting militarization of the police!  HRC and Bill Clinton as guilty as sin!!!

I think the notion that congress will work in harmony with HRC has been completely dispelled!  Yes I think that revolution is going to be necessary!!!
Without a revolution nothing changes!  Question is who is energizing voters!  Who is growing the voter base?  Who will turn out young voters?  Who will get voters out that traditionally don't vote?  Who is getting the independent vote?  By far Bernie Sanders is the best hope for meaningful change and HRC is the best candidate for more status quo and republican obstruction!

Look at the polling trajectory of where Sanders started and how far HRC has fallen!  Amazing and totally missing from the discussion!  

Hillary Clinton is asking us to believe the corrupting influence of money does not change congressional bills and votes!  She is asking us to believe the one percent are spending billions in lobbying for no reason!  If you are buying this I got some things I would like to sell you!!!

Yes the media blackout is in full effect!  Check out Trump coverage Vs. Sanders!!!

Guns and abortion! Keeping the people distracted and stuck on stupid!  Divide and conquer!  Only rich lives matter?

Stand up to Hill first!!  Trump is next!

About as fair and balanced as the Corporate media!  Feel the Bern!

The two party system has been playing the same game for forty years!   The only ones benefiting and getting what they want is the one percent!  

Just a trending news story brought to you by repetition creates reality inc.  

Also brought to you by just ignore Bernie Sanders inc.

Not all that different from how Bill Cosby handled these questions!  Bill Clinton is just a much better liar!  Check out the list of allegations and the number of women making them!  I believe victims and I don't trust the Clintons!  
Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby used power, intimidation, and a persona larger than life to silence a lot of women!  Just wrong!  Rape was part of the allegations and money was paid out!  How many women need to come forward before we believe them?

HRC is enabler in chief!",1070863933006660_1070916283001425

Some will think this an outrageous label to apply to the frontrunner for a major party’s presidential nomination. But there is a greater imperative not to be silent in the face of demagoguery. 

Trump needs to rely on these large brain-washing rallies to garner up support.  I don’t blame them though, what else is there to talk about?  Obama has thrived in office.

RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25/month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more… all while republicans bleated about Benghazi took pointless votes to repeal the ACA, and did nothing for anybody except the top one percent.  

Additionally, Donald Trump in this campaign has gone after African Americans, immigrants, Latinos, Asians, women, Muslims and the disabled. In 1973 The United States filed a suit against Donald Trump due to his racist activities against blacks and Hispanics (US Citizen Hispanics from Puerto Rico).",1070816833011370_1070817236344663

They need to rely on these large brain-washing rallies to garner up support.  I don’t blame them though, what else is there to talk about?  Obama has thrived in office.

RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25/month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more… all while republicans bleated about Benghazi took pointless votes to repeal the ACA, and did nothing for anybody except the top one percent.  

It turns out that Obama is indeed “the adult in the room,” and yes, the Chess Master. Trump, on the other hand, is a man who represents everything that's wrong with this country. Yet, people will vote for him. The very same individuals who stand to lose the most. Wake up. He only cares about himself.",1070262853066768_1070718473021206

The same wording is used for treaties as judges.

That being said  in 1919 the Senate did not approve of the treaty of Versaille as a consequence the US did not make peace with Germany. It was not until 21 that peace was made.

The Senate can deny whomever it wants.

Additionally Obama filibustered justice Alito in 2006. Which is what republicans are proposing to do as well as exercise many of their other constitutional rights.

2016-02-18T05:02:39+0000,"Bernie Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the non-defensive Iraq War. He rose to national prominence following his 2010 filibuster against the proposed extension of the Bush tax cuts for mega-wealthy individuals.

Even during historic senate/congressional grid-lock, Bernie is a leading progressive voice on issues such as income inequality, universal healthcare, parental leave, climate change, LGBT rights, and campaign finance reform. 

He is also outspoken on civil rights and civil liberties, and has been particularly critical of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system and mass surveillance policies and programs.

Sanders favors policies similar to those of social democratic parties...particularly those instituted by Nordic countries.

Don't get fooled by the sly Fox🐺

Comparing Socialism with Democratic Socialism is like comparing Foosball with Football.

A bird is not a plane,
And a plane is not a bird...

And Bernie Sanders is not a 'Marxist Socialist'...but a pro-market/pro-people Democratic Socialist who wants a more even playing field for all people including the middle class...via a stronger mixture of social (people) interests, rather than too heavily tilted corporate interests...like most economically strong Scandinavian countries. 

A Democratic Socialist is pro-market, but seeks to restrain destructive excesses and channel government's use of money into creating more opportunities for more people. 

Democratic Socialists think that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not simply to make profits for a few.

Fyi..Bernie Sanders is only 1 year older than Joe Biden...5 years older than Donald Trump...6 years older than Hillary Clinton. Bernie is a decade younger than half of the Supreme Court Justices. And Bernie has been a public servant for 35 years...longer than some of the Founding Fathers.

So...the claim that ""He's too old or inexperienced to be president"" is a moot point. 

Bernie is Wise, Experienced, and he authentically cares about US✔️

2016-02-18T02:03:23+0000,"If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you’re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!

When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.

Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.

Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier’s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.

Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.

Many younger votes will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.

Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. 

Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.

Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the #$%$ eruption” and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:

She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.

She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. 

After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.

Hillary’s devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.

Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” a total of 56 times while under oath.

After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.

What a swell party – ready for another four or eight year of this type of low-life mess?

Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the “pay to play” schemes of the Clinton Foundation – we have no idea what shoe will fall next. 

But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words “what difference does it make?”",1070331013059952_1070354203057633

2016-02-17T17:50:29+0000,"The reason the republican party is dying is because the Koch brothers took over the republican party and are dictating all that the elected republicans must do in office. This is not democratic and is forcing elected republicans to take opposite stands on issues than what they really want to be for. So much power invested in two people is the downfall of the Republican Party. When Obama took office he cut the hot line the Koch brothers had to the White House where they dictated policy to Bush and Cheney. It is unbearable for them to be close to the richest family in the world and not have more say in the government. Folks - all republican obstruction ordered from the Koch brothers can be seen to start from when they were told they would not direct Obamas policies. This turned out to be good for America but we have to deal with the repercussions of the strength of so much wealth and power in just two people. McConnell was found to have been given over 20 million dollars while senate leader and McConnell will not say where it came from. I urge the senate to get to the bottom of this for the sake of the two party system.  Granted the democrats have billionaire backers but they don’t have nearly the scope of direct power the Koch brothers have over the whole party.  It is not a coincidence that every republican candidate for president, with the exception of Trump, ran to the Koch brothers prior to announcing their candidacy for their sanction.  That said, if the president wants to get an up or down vote on any competent Supreme Court nominee he should not ask McConnell to open the senate for a vote he should come out in the media and ask the Koch brothers to have McConnell OK a vote on nominees.",1069364296489957_1070081296418257

I think the notion that congress will work in harmony with HRC has been completely dispelled!  Yes I think that revolution is going to be necessary!!!
Without a revolution nothing changes!  Question is who is energizing voters!  Who is growing the voter base?  Who will turn out young voters?  Who will get voters out that traditionally don't vote?  Who is getting the independent vote?  By far Bernie Sanders is the best hope for meaningful change and HRC is the best candidate for more status quo and republican obstruction!

Look at the polling trajectory of where Sanders started and how far HRC has fallen!  Amazing and totally missing from the discussion!  

Hillary Clinton is asking us to believe the corrupting influence of money does not change congressional bills and votes!  She is asking us to believe the one percent are spending billions in lobbying for no reason!  If you are buying this I got some things I would like to sell you!!!

Yes the media blackout is in full effect!  Check out Trump coverage Vs. Sanders!!!

Guns and abortion! Keeping the people distracted and stuck on stupid!  Divide and conquer!  Only rich lives matter?

Stand up to Hill first!!  Trump is next!

About as fair and balanced as the Corporate media!  Feel the Bern!

The two party system has been playing the same game for forty years!   The only ones benefiting and getting what they want is the one percent!  

Just a trending news story brought to you by repetition creates reality inc.  

Also brought to you by just ignore Bernie Sanders inc.

Not all that different from how Bill Cosby handled these questions!  Bill Clinton is just a much better liar!  Check out the list of allegations and the number of women making them!  I believe victims and I don't trust the Clintons!  
Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby used power, intimidation, and a persona larger than life to silence a lot of women!  Just wrong!  Rape was part of the allegations and money was paid out!  How many women need to come forward before we believe them?

Trump wants low wages but now after Bernie pointed it out he changed his tune proving he is copying Bernie and lying as well. 

Bernie is the new FDR and if we let him he will stop the corruption and bring our country into prosperity again. The other candidates are paid for by the corporations.

2016-02-17T15:53:21+0000,"If you want to see what works:
Let's compare WI under Walker and MN under Dayton since both took 
office and see what is working. Both states switched leadership
and legislatures then. In MN Dayton inherited $5.9 billion deficit
(Walker half that) MN had a $1.9 billion surplus going into new 
budget, Walker a similar deficit. Since Feb 2010 MN added 197,000 
private sector jobs (with a tax increase on higher incomes and an 
increase in minimum wage(supposedly real job killers) WI 167,000.
Walker promised to add 250,000 in his first term. MN made up
payments to k-12 schools of
over a billion dollars (payments that republicans had delayed) 
and increased educational spending at all levels including
financing all day kindergarten. Walker cutting funding for 
education including proposing $300 million cut to U of WI
and asking them to freeze tuition on top of it. Last thing
republicans want is an educated electorate. Only effect of RTW 
is RTW for less pay and benefits. Trickle down 
has never worked. Quite evident what is working and what is not.
Another thing Republicans here in MN keep saying our taxes drive
business away. MN has jumped up to 9th on Forbes rankings of best 
states to do business in. Forbes also ranked MN 7th in economic 
climate, and 2nd in quality of life. CNBC just ranked MN the top 
state for business.

Don't think the comparison to MN is valid?

*Obama thought that he could bring change by waiving a magic wand
*Obama was just good at  giving speeches
*Hillary said that ""she has a lifetime of experience and John McCain had a lifetime of experience and Obama has a speech he gave in 2002
*that Obama's campaign was a fairytale
*that even Jesse Jackson won South Carolina
*that Obama did not really oppose the Iraq War
*that MLK was just about speeches but that it took LBJ to pass the Civil Rights Act
*made fun of Obama saying that if he won the skies will open
*brought up Reverend Wright, the photo of Obama with a turban in Indonisea implying Obama was not really American
*that Obama was an elitist who did not understand gun culture and opposed guns
*that Obama could not win white working class voters
*that Obama would not know how to answer the 3am phone call
*that she was staying in the race (even when she had lost the primary) because Bobby Kennedy was assasinated in June.

And now that Bernie Sanders is challenging Hillary the story repeats itself. Hillary and her campaign are saying that Bernie:

*is a single issue candidate
*that breaking up big banks does not end racism and sexism
*that elections are not just about economic theory
*has only cared about Black voters for 40 days
*that he didnt really participate in the civil rights moment
*is naive and cannot get his proposals done
*his supporters are sexist and just like the Tea Party
*thinks he can wave a magic wand and get things done
*his campaign is a fairytale
*he is in bed with the NRA
*she is really stronger on Wall Street
*he wants to destroy Obamacare
*medicare for all is not possible
*has no experience
*does not have plans to reform criminal justice
*only talks about Wall Street
*is running a smear by saying Hillary takes money from Wall Street
*cannot win minority voters

This election is about ending what generations of American politics has left for the next generation. The vote you will cast in your primary, and in the general election is about what we will do for our kids and grand kids. We have an opportunity to start this nation on a better path, where those who will follow us will have it better than we did.

 There are consequences to our upcoming actions and we must choose the correct path. We have a chance to leave a legacy of bringing a country up to speed with regards to education and health care. We can set precedents about handling international conflicts without bearing the casualties of knee-jerk wars. We can begin the process of leaving behind massive debt for future generations to resolve. We can provide a child born to poverty a reason and a chance to believe he or she can succeed without seeing their circumstances as their fate. Often, a child born to poverty sees the life around them as their own path, and is deprived of the belief that their own efforts can result in improving their own circumstances. We can improve this, and give every child a dream that they can reach. Nobody needs to look ahead in life and determine the only way to survive is through gangs, crime and ultimately incarceration. They do need to know that with the proper effort, nothing is out of reach. 

This election isn't about us because these are not things that we will wake up and have on 1/21/2017. That's when the process of setting these improvements in place begins for our children and grand children. 

Will we give them a life without fear of illness or injury determining their financial fate? Will we tell them that working hard and demonstrating dedication to themselves will be what it takes to get a strong education? Will we begin to pay the debts our generations created ourselves, and stop passing that burden along? Will we promise them that we will not send them to die in the name of oil and into conflicts, without a firm plan to bring them home, and if need be, provide all of the proper care needed to return them whole, mentally and physically, as they were? Can we honestly tell them we've begun to stop destroying the planet and environment of this rock we call home? YES, to all of these, and the first and most important step is a vote. A vote for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and those who support him, is the beginning of leaving generations better off than our own. SHB.",1068674933225560_1068763333216720

2016-02-16T00:22:03+0000,"TIME recently published “The Party of No,” an article
adapted from my new book, The New New Deal: The
Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era. It 
reveals some of my reporting on the Republican 
plot to obstruct President Obama before he even
took office, including secret meetings led by
House GOP whip Eric Cantor (in December 2008)
and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell 
(in early January 2009) in which they laid 
out their daring (though cynical and political) 
no-honeymoon strategy of all-out resistance 
to a popular President-elect during an 
economic emergency. “If he was for it,” former 
Ohio Senator George Voinovich explained, “we 
had to be against it.” The excerpt includes 
a special bonus nugget of Mitt Romney 
dissing the Tea Party.
• Vice President Biden told me that during 
the transition, he was warned not to expect 
any bipartisan cooperation on major votes. 
“I spoke to seven different Republican 
Senators who said, ‘Joe, I’m not going to 
be able to help you on anything,’ ” he 
recalled. His informants said McConnell 
had demanded unified resistance. “The way 
it was characterized to me was, ‘For the 
next two years, we can’t let you succeed 
in anything. That’s our ticket to coming 
back,’ ” Biden said. The Vice President 
said he hasn’t even told Obama who his 
sources were, but Bob Bennett of Utah 
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania both 
confirmed they had conversations with 
Biden along those lines.

2016-02-15T22:42:38+0000,"GOP has been obstructing, sabotaging and disrespecting president Obama for 7+ years. After all that I want the next president to be someone who will protect his legacy & build on the progress he has made. I don't agree with him on everything and I don't think he has done enough but with all the unprecedented fight he faced he had made some progress that need protection. 

I will definitely campaign & vote for whoever gets the nomination but strongly  believe Hillary is the MOST qualified candidate in the race. And she has been right in the front lines taking the heat from GOP for decades and she is still standing. After watching the Marathon Benghazi hearing that left Hillary unscathed, the questioners looking like fools and mostly made Hillary look more presidential, I strongly believe she is the best candidate to take the fight to GOP and win. There are a lot of signs showing GOP wants Bernie to win, it should make you ask why. 

I respect & love Bernie. But when  I start to ask myself who is ready to be a commander in chief on day one is when I lose feeling the Bern. With this unstable world we live in right now more than ever we need someone with a deep knowledge of foreign policy. Someone who knows the leaders of the world & have worked with them before and understand their weaknesses and strengths. Someone who has worked with world leaders enough to know who we need to partner with to fight against terrorism & most importantly know how to approach the very diverse world leaders. Someone who knows what method works with which world leader. Looking at both sides Hillary is the ONLY one ready to be commander in chief on day one. Yes, Bernie voted against the war that created this mess in the world but that doesn't change the reality we face right now. We need a president who is ready for what we face right now. Period! 

Like millions of millennials I am drowning in student debt while the middleman is making millions off interest rates. And I believe my nephews and nieces deserve the opportunity to receive an affordable, quality education just like all children out there. Both Hillary and Bernie address these issues, both acknowledge they are issues that need to be fixed. If I'm just going with my emotions I really like what Bernie say. But when I start to use my brain and ask how he is gonna solve these issues is when again I lose the Bern. I prefer Hillary's  more thought through  & realistic approach. Nothing wrong with being idealistic but  we need to also think about the consequence of radical changes and how likely it is to make those radical changes. For example I don't support Bernie's idea of free college education for all especially when our economy is still fragile & when it will increase taxes on people who are already struggling. And I strongly believe people who can afford paying for their education  shouldn't be burdening working people by increasing their taxes. I do support Hillary's idea of making quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it, without saddling them with decades of debt. Keyword being ""willing to work for it."" Not just free. I worked hard to put myself through college, I take pride in that. While I don't want them to drown in student loans i want my nephews & nieces to work for their higher education. Work for it by working hard in high school to get some scholarships, work hard to apply for different scholarships & grants, and participate in work-study programs in college.....etc 

Oh, I also don't believe just because she has a super PAC Hillary is not gonna fight hard to fix income inequality in this country & to take big dark money out of politics. The reality is with the political climate we have now almost all politicians have to have super PACs to compete. The irony/hypocrisy is Bernie has benefited from super PAC money big time while condemning it. For example accompanying him through Iowa caucuses was a group of nurses whose “super PAC” has doled out close to $1 million on ads and other kinds of campaign support for him. Also with ALL his talk about all the money in politics the fact is Bernie is outspending Hillary. Yes, he got the money in small donation but still he received he gotta spend big money to stay competitive. That's why he outspent Hillary in Iowa and  New Hampshire. It is hypercritical of him to complain about big money in politics but he is willing to spend big time. 

Bernie have been in politics for decades playing the same political game ALL politicians play within the same political establishment. The fact now he is trying to make himself look  like an outsider and call everyone else part of an establishment because he knows people are not happy with politicians is by itself politics 101. It is simply playing into people's emotions just like Trump tells his supporters he is gonna build the wall & make America great again over and over. He is not worried about how he is gonna do it & his supporters certainly are not worried about how he is gonna do it, just the fact he is saying that is getting them emotionally involved with him. Bernie is doing the same thing when he talks about Wall Street over and over again. His supporters are not worried about the how part as much as they are invested emotionally in him by him saying he is gonna fix Wall Street. And the fact he keeps talking about Hillary making money by giving speeches when almost all politicians do the same thing when they leave public office is another politics 101. My point is I don't see Bernie as this pure superhero here to save the day, I see him as a career politician who is capable of saying/doing anything to get elected just like ALL politicians(of course including Hillary).

I don't care if you black, white, yellow, orange....etc if you think you're part of some kind of political revolution but disrespect civil rights icon like John Lewis, your revolution ain't going nowhere. You can't make progress by walking all over the people who put their lives on the line for a real revolution. This 2016  political revolution starting  to sound more like some kind of cult movement. If it's about disrespecting someone like John Lewis because he is NOT feeling the Bern or for simply answering the question he was asked then I am officially out of this political revolution because as a black person I know if it wasn't for people like him who were willing to give up their lives I wouldn't be enjoying the rights I have now.

2016-02-15T20:08:04+0000,"Appointment and confirmation[edit]
Main article: Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States

The President of the United States appoints justices ""by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.""[70] Most presidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views, although a justice's decisions may end up being contrary to a president's expectations. Because the Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, a president may nominate anyone to serve, subject to Senate confirmation.

In modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955.[71] Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert Bork in 1987.

Nevertheless, not every nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. Although Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination, a nominee may be filibustered once debate has begun in the full Senate. No nomination for associate justice has ever been filibustered, but President Lyndon Johnson's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice was successfully filibustered in 1968. A president may also withdraw a nomination before the actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee, most recently Harriet Miers in 2006.

Once the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and sign a commission, to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed, before the new justice can take office.[72] The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the confirmation or swearing-in date.[73]

Before 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, the process has taken much longer. Some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[74] According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).[75][76]",1068542173238836_1068562106570176

 Obama’s most likely SCOTUS pick is someone that the Republicans have previously supported – Democrat Judge Sri Srinivasan. In fact, they unanimously nominated him in 2013 (97-0) to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, so they would look like complete idiots when they try to justify why Srinivasan shouldn’t be a nominee for this position.

In actuality, Srinivasan is a huge threat to the conservative party. With his Asian-American and Indian-American background, he would be the first minority from both demographics to be nominated. Democrats absolutely love him, and Obama himself has referred to Srinivasan as “a trailblazer who personifies the best of America” – and he’s got an impressive track record to prove it. For five years, Srinivasan worked in the Justice Department under George W. Bush and has been endorsed by twelve former Solicitors General – some of which were Republicans who stood behind him even though he argued against conservative initiatives like the Defense of Marriage Act.",1068542173238836_1068562493236804

I'm not comfortable with a more liberal supreme court, but I can live with that as well. What I'm having trouble with is the lack of civility from both sides. This man is not even in the ground, and people are openly disrespecting his name,his contribution, his service, and by extension his grieving family. Are those posting such vile statements not even capable of showing even the slightest measure of respect. I say again that this man is not even in the ground yet. Yet we have some already fighting about his replacement. We have those already denouncing President Obama's nominee, which for the record has not even been made. Does anyone else find this behavior despicable? Let us lay this man to rest with the respect and thanks for his life time of service to our country. Let us all come together as a country, and set aside our bitter rivalries. Let us go forward in the hope of making a better future for ourselves and our fellow Americans.

2016-02-13T15:32:45+0000,"TIME recently published “The Party of No,” an article
adapted from my new book, The New New Deal: The
Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era. It 
reveals some of my reporting on the Republican 
plot to obstruct President Obama before he even
took office, including secret meetings led by
House GOP whip Eric Cantor (in December 2008)
and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell 
(in early January 2009) in which they laid 
out their daring (though cynical and political) 
no-honeymoon strategy of all-out resistance 
to a popular President-elect during an 
economic emergency. “If he was for it,” former 
Ohio Senator George Voinovich explained, “we 
had to be against it.” The excerpt includes 
a special bonus nugget of Mitt Romney 
dissing the Tea Party.
• Vice President Biden told me that during 
the transition, he was warned not to expect 
any bipartisan cooperation on major votes. 
“I spoke to seven different Republican 
Senators who said, ‘Joe, I’m not going to 
be able to help you on anything,’ ” he 
recalled. His informants said McConnell 
had demanded unified resistance. “The way 
it was characterized to me was, ‘For the 
next two years, we can’t let you succeed 
in anything. That’s our ticket to coming 
back,’ ” Biden said. The Vice President 
said he hasn’t even told Obama who his 
sources were, but Bob Bennett of Utah 
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania both 
confirmed they had conversations with 
Biden along those lines.",1066278563465197_1066880993404954

2016-02-13T15:33:15+0000,"I can't take credit for what follows but I agree 100%.
 10 reasons why I’m thankful that
 Barack Obama is our Commander-in-Chief.
 1. Because we’ve had continuous private-sector job growth every
 single month since March of 2010, creating well over 12 million jobs.
 2. He sees sending in large numbers of American ground troops into 
a war – a war that would almost certainly result in heavy casualties
– as a last resort, not the first option like many Republicans. 
3. Since he signed the Affordable Care Act into law, millions of
 Americans have gained health insurance who would have otherwise
 gone without. 
4. We avoided another Great Depression due in large
 part to the stimulus he passed in 2009 – with almost no support 
from the Republican party – that stopped the economy from spiraling
even further out of control.
5. Despite all of the problems he faced entering office following
the catastrophic Bush presidency, he’s still managed to reduce our
deficits by over $1 trillion since he was elected. It’s the largest
deficit reduction since WWII.
6. No matter what propaganda Republicans try to perpetuate about 
him, the truth is he’s outperformed Reagan on jobs, growth and investing.
7. LGBT rights have progressed further during his administration
 than under any other president in United States history, as proud 
gay Americans are now serving their country without fear of being 
kicked out of the military for their sexual orientation, and 
same-sex marriage is now legal in the United States. 
8. Because he knows that we can’t call ourselves the greatest 
nation on Earth if we turn out back on thousands of desperate 
women and children fleeing a terrorist group that wants to 
slaughter them.
9. He knows that the greatness of the United States was built 
on hope, optimism and courage – not fear, hate and anger.
10. Our current unemployment rate is 5 percent, lower than 
at any time during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. In fact, in 
2014, we saw the fastest drop in unemployment in 30 years.",1066278563465197_1066881216738265

2016-02-13T04:32:35+0000,"Bernie have been in politics for decades playing the same political game ALL politicians play within the same political establishment. The fact now he is trying to make himself look  like an outsider and call everyone else part of an establishment because he knows people are not happy with politicians is by itself politics 101. It is simply playing into people's emotions just like Trump tells his supporters he is gonna build the wall & make America great again over and over. He is not worried about how he is gonna do it & his supporters certainly are not worried about how he is gonna do it, just the fact he is saying that is getting them emotionally involved with him. Bernie is doing the same thing when he talks about Wall Street over and over again, making this talking point an answer to almost all questions on debates/interviews. His supporters are not worried about the how part as much as they are invested emotionally in him by him saying he is gonna fix Wall Street. And the fact he keeps talking about Hillary making money by giving speeches when almost all politicians do when they leave public office is another politics 101. My point is I don't see Bernie as this pure superhero here to save the day, I see him as a career politician who is capable of saying/doing anything to get elected just like ALL politicians(of course including Hillary). 

And this is another proof Bernie's campaign is the same as all other political campaigns who say and do whatever to get some votes.

I don't care if you white, black, yellow.....If you think you're part of some kind of political revolution but disrespect civil rights icon like John Lewis, your revolution ain't going nowhere. You can't make progress by walking all over the people who put their lives on the line for a real revolution. This 2016  political revolution starting  to sound more like some kind of cult movement. If it's about disrespecting someone like John Lewis because he is NOT feeling the Bern then I am officially out of this political revolution because as a black person I know if it wasn't for people like him who were willing to give up their lives I wouldn't be enjoying the rights I have now. Any political revolution that walks all over any civil rights icon is NOT a true revolution that's for the black community. Period!",1066295853463468_1066553646771022

Yes the military industrial media complex are able to manipulate congress in the same way as big oil, big Pharma, and Wall Street!  Expect more status quo with HRC and more stupid wars of aggression! 

Look at the polling trajectory of where Sanders started and how far HRC has fallen!  Amazing and totally missing from the discussion!  

Hillary Clinton is asking us to believe the corrupting influence of money does not change congressional bills and votes!  She is asking us to believe the one percent are spending billions in lobbying for no reason!  If you are buying this I got some things I would like to sell you!!!

Yes the media blackout is in full effect!  Check out Trump coverage Vs. Sanders!!!

Guns and abortion! Keeping the people distracted and stuck on stupid!  Divide and conquer!  Only rich lives matter?

Stand up to Hill first!!  Trump is next!

About as fair and balanced as the Corporate media!  Feel the Bern!

The two party system has been playing the same game for forty years!   The only ones benefiting and getting what they want is the one percent!  

Just a trending news story brought to you by repetition creates reality inc.  

Also brought to you by just ignore Bernie Sanders inc.

Not all that different from how Bill Cosby handled these questions!  Bill Clinton is just a much better liar!  Check out the list of allegations and the number of women making them!  I believe victims and I don't trust the Clintons!  
Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby used power, intimidation, and a persona larger than life to silence a lot of women!  Just wrong!  Rape was part of the allegations and money was paid out!  How many women need to come forward before we believe them?

I hope you know that the Political Revolution starts on 02/01/2016 in IOWA and this means no more talk, it’s time for action. 
WE THE PEOPLE ARE STARTING OUR POLITICAL REVOLUTION
If you are too afraid to stand up for your RIGHTS then you cannot complain of what’s to come, for what you are fighting for is not just for you but everyone that come after you, your children and grandchildren. It’s NOW or never, we have waited for the people that we elect to get us out of this BIG MONEY control, the wait is OVER the elected officials are in too deep with BIG MONEY.
We have to do this or BIG MONEY will run your life forever, we had to do this in the Nineteen Thirty’s, then in 1980s Big money started to run amuck and kept telling us to CUT our TAXES and WE will CREATE JOBS, it’s been OVER THIRTY years, WHERE are the JOBS? Oh wait there in CHINA and other Countries without regulations. Big Money milked us dry and collapsed in 2008 and then WE had to bail them out, what the HELL. They get a bail out and we have to suffer, it’s time to get MAD, It was OUR TAX MONEY that WE worked for to help US and they got IT. Look they are NOT paying their fair share of taxes to benefit US? I don’t think so. What would have happened if instead they bailed us out? We would still be IN OUR HOMES driving OUR CARS PAYING OUR BILLS, instead we have to live on the streets and live in POVERTY. If you know of a homeless person take them with you to CAUCUS get them registered and let then help out as well.
IT IS TIME FOR ALL OF US TO RISE UP TO THE UNFAIR BALANCE OF POWER
FEEL THE BERN FROM WE THE PEOPLE
We are at WAR with a CORRUPTED SYSTEM, for those of you that think the Bernie Sanders POLITICAL REVOLUTION is just a theme, you are WRONG, it’s what we are going to do. We don’t need a gun to get our way, WE will use our VOTE and our bodies as our weapon of choice. See you don’t have to KILL to get your point across, numbers of people can do the same without KILLING anyone. This is not to say that while we are at it some of us may go to jail, but I bet when it’s all said and done, some people that thought they were above the law due to having MONEY, will find themselves behind bars.
The POLITICAL REVOLUTION of the United States of America Starts TODAY
This is NOT a game or a gimmick this is a WAR on BIG MONEY and taking back our government. If you stand in our way we will move you, if you try and STOP US we will grow LARGER. Join us or get out of the way, a STORM is coming in the likes that this NATION has never seen and hopefully will never have to happen again.
This is NOT just about the United States of America for this is affecting the entire GLOBE, our COUNTRY is not the only one that is FIGHTING BIG MONEY. The FIGHT STARTS HERE AND IT STARTS NOW!!!!!
This is a WAR on POLITICS, it's NOT just a President we are electing, there are a lot of Congress seat that will be taken (the do NOTHING congress) as well as we have a large number of Supreme Court Judges that are out as well. Thing can be changed to get it done, if not we know where the WHITE HOUSE is and were CONGRESS sits. If we have something NOT getting done that we want done, we have to march onto the window of CONGRESS and tell them ourselves. People in this country have to STOP being lazy and yell from the comfort of their living room, but hey we have plenty of us LIVING ON THE STREETS that wouldn't mind marching. The STORM is coming and people better wake up, you join us or get out of the way. For we will bring our huddled masses.",1065334460226274_1065481013544952

Hillary said Nafta was good and that the TPP was the gold standard. Now she is against the TPP because she has to copy Bernie. Why get the lying copy when you can get the real thing? 

Bernie wants a single-payer health insurance system. Hillary wants to strengthen Obamacare.  Hillary will make your health insurance even more expensive. Mine is currently $475/month (compared to my $25/month car insurance from Insurance Panda, or my $10/month dental insurance, but I digress).  Hillary is in bed with big pharma.

Trump wants low wages but now after Bernie pointed it out he changed his tune proving he is copying Bernie and lying as well. 

Bernie is the new FDR and if we let him he will stop the corruption and bring our country into prosperity again. The other candidates are paid for by the corporations.

2016-02-11T13:22:58+0000,"Why I feel the Bern?

     The owner of the Bern Machine asked me this simple question at the Palm Springs Pride Parade some months back. “What got you interested in Bernie Sanders?” he inquired and for a man who smears his opinion all over anyone willing to listen I drew a blank. Before I knew it my mouth was off to the races leaving my brain churning in its wake. God only knows if it was even coherent but I was yammering on about student loans and the tax implication for higher wage earners, real common man issues. I sounded like an asshole, of that I’m sure. Now, here I am alone in my 3600 square foot home, new cars in the garage, kids in private school and slowly edging ever closer to that simultaneously hated and coveted one percent. What’s my problem shouldn’t I be siding with the “makers” in the hopes keeping more for myself? 
    Here is the truth. I was born to a single teenage mother in the late seventies. Were it not for the multitude of social welfare programs that I benefited from as a child my piece of the American dream would belong to someone higher born than I. Head Start, food stamps, reduced lunch in my formative years gave mom and I a fighting chance. She eventually married and soon my father landed a solid middle class state job as a prison guard. Thanks to the union he had affordable health care, raises at regular intervals and ample vacation time. Sounds like an organization we should focus on crushing because it’s hellbent on cutting into private sector profits and running up government debt, does’t it? 
    With mom as a nurses aid and dad working for the state our family of four was by no means wealthy but we were loved and fed. Ultimately, that's what makes someone truly rich. My sister and I both knew college would be a challenge to find the financing for so we ended up enlisting. She served in Iraq and as a bonus didn’t die. We in the decades since have utilized the GI Bill, VA Home and Small Business loans and other veterans services. It’s safe to say I carved out a life one socialist program at a time.
    I feel the Bern because my heart and life are a testimony to Senator Sanders message. Call me a democratic socialist if you want, but if I can live in a country where a child born in South Central LA has the same shot at success as one born in Beverly Hills, that is the America I choose.                                                      ~ The Accidental Pharmacist",1065162760243444_1065165623576491

Look at the polling trajectory of where Sanders started and how far HRC has fallen!  Amazing and totally missing from the discussion!  Watch for it cause Sanders will soon be leading HRC nationally!  The lying cheating fascists will be throwing kitchen sinks and all sorts of distractions to move the conversation away from economics and back to corporate talking points!!!

Hillary Clinton is asking us to believe the corrupting influence of money does not change congressional bills and votes!  She is asking us to believe the one percent are spending billions in lobbying for no reason!  If you are buying this I got some things I would like to sell you!!!

Yes the media blackout is in full effect!  Check out Trump coverage Vs. Sanders!!!

Guns and abortion! Keeping the people distracted and stuck on stupid!  Divide and conquer!  Only rich lives matter?

Stand up to Hill first!!  Trump is next!

About as fair and balanced as the Corporate media!  Feel the Bern!

The two party system has been playing the same game for forty years!   The only ones benefiting and getting what they want is the one percent!  

Just a trending news story brought to you by repetition creates reality inc.  

Also brought to you by just ignore Bernie Sanders inc.

Not all that different from how Bill Cosby handled these questions!  Bill Clinton is just a much better liar!  Check out the list of allegations and the number of women making them!  I believe victims and I don't trust the Clintons!  
Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby used power, intimidation, and a persona larger than life to silence a lot of women!  Just wrong!  Rape was part of the allegations and money was paid out!  How many women need to come forward before we believe them?

Look at the polling trajectory of where Sanders started and how far HRC has fallen!  Amazing and totally missing from the discussion!  Watch for it cause Sanders will soon be leading HRC nationally!  The lying cheating fascists will be throwing kitchen sinks and all sorts of distractions to move the conversation away from economics and back to corporate talking points!!!

Hillary Clinton is asking us to believe the corrupting influence of money does not change congressional bills and votes!  She is asking us to believe the one percent are spending billions in lobbying for no reason!  If you are buying this I got some things I would like to sell you!!!

Yes the media blackout is in full effect!  Check out Trump coverage Vs. Sanders!!!

Guns and abortion! Keeping the people distracted and stuck on stupid!  Divide and conquer!  Only rich lives matter?

Stand up to Hill first!!  Trump is next!

About as fair and balanced as the Corporate media!  Feel the Bern!

The two party system has been playing the same game for forty years!   The only ones benefiting and getting what they want is the one percent!  

Just a trending news story brought to you by repetition creates reality inc.  

Also brought to you by just ignore Bernie Sanders inc.

Not all that different from how Bill Cosby handled these questions!  Bill Clinton is just a much better liar!  Check out the list of allegations and the number of women making them!  I believe victims and I don't trust the Clintons!  
Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby used power, intimidation, and a persona larger than life to silence a lot of women!  Just wrong!  Rape was part of the allegations and money was paid out!  How many women need to come forward before we believe them?

Mine is currently $475/month (compared to my $25/month car insurance from Insurance Panda, or my $10/month dental insurance, but I digress).  Hillary is in bed with big pharma.

2016-02-09T19:24:51+0000,"""For those who are still undecided, here are some highlights on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders 🇺🇸

Bernie wants to make healthcare available for everyone as a right, so neither you or your employer will have to pay health insurance directly, it’s just provided for everyone as a human right through a small tax that will replace your current health insurance payments. His plan will end up saving the US $6 billion in the next decade compared to what we currently spend on health care and will actually SAVE the average household about 5,000 every year and the average business about $10,000 a year. We are the ONLY major country in the world that doesn't provide health care for their people as a right.

He wants to make sure all women get at least 12-weeks of medical leave after having a baby so they can get to know their new child and learn to be a mom (this plan will only cost americans $1.61 a week) and he wants pay equality for women. He has a 50-year history of standing up for civil and minority rights and was even present at MLK's ""I have a dream"" speech.

He wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 gradually within 4 years, a plan which top economists agree will strengthen our economy because the more money people make, the more they spend on products and services. When companies sell more products and services, they make more money and hire more people to meet those demands. This plan improves the quality of life and income for individuals as well as businesses.

He wants to cap credit card interest rates at 15%, he wants to cap ATM fees at $2 because people shouldn’t have to pay up to $4.50 ($2 from the ATM and $2 or $2.50 for using a different bank than your own) to take out THEIR OWN money especially since ATM’s save the banks money.  He wants to equip the postal service with minor banking abilities so people in poor neighborhoods don’t have to go to paycheck advance places and get ripped off.

He wants to keep the police accountable when someone dies while in custody. He wants to end private prisons (the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world and has more people currently in prison than China - a COMMUNIST country with 4.3 times as many people as the US.

He wants to give students the ability to refinance their student loans at a lower percentage rate and he acknowledges that a college degree is the same as a high school diploma in today's world and he feels that nobody should be deprived of an education because of their income or inability to pay off loans so he wants to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, this will be paid for through a tax on wall street speculation (high-risk investments).  He feels it’s wrong that the taxpayers bailed them out and they still gave themselves millions in bonuses and changed little of their behavior so it’s their time to pay their fare share. He wants to break up ""too big to fail"" banks to prevent another financial collapse. He also wants to put those that caused the financial collapse in jail. He argues that a kid can go to jail for years and have their life and record ruined for smoking marijuana but the crooks on wall street that destroyed the lives of billions of people all over the world with their reckless behavior and greed just got a $700 billion bailout and a slap on the wrist.

He wants to end loopholes that save companies like wal-mart billions ($6 billion last year) while they push their employees to sign up for government assistance and he wants to end loopholes that allow companies to keep their money stashed in the cayman islands and other “tax havens”.

He wants to close loopholes that allow people to buy guns online and at gun shows without background checks. He tries to avoid war which saves us trillions, he wants to take big money out of politics so the US can be a democracy again.

He wants to expand social security so that when you retire, you have a decent income to keep you alive and happy, not just barely getting by.

He’s only 5 years older than Donald Trump, 6 years older than Hillary Clinton and 5 years YOUNGER than John McCain whose age became an issue 8 years ago when he ran against Obama and he’s still alive and well.

Today, 62 people own HALF of the world’s wealth...5 years ago that number was 388...  Bernie cares about people like you and I...and he’s funded by people like you and I...he’s literally received more individual contributions ($27 average) than ANY presidential candidate EVER at this point in the race....all the other people running for president are funded by the same people that are turning america into a place where only the ultra-rich and powerful have a say in what goes on.

It was nighttime so the sun was out
I drunk my food and ate my water
In the middle of the block, standing on the corner
Some pregnant man went into labor
This illiterate dude was reading the newspaper
All of that liquor must've got me high
It was raining outside so the ground was dry
Two non-violent dudes started to fight
He reached in his pocket and shot em with a knife
The dude came back and stabbed him with a gun
The man in the wheelchair started to run
You couldn't even hear it it was so damn loud
The cats started barking, the dog said meow
Uh oh, somebody must've called the cops
I guess the deaf man must've heard the shots

Trump and his supporters are cowards who hate America. They defecate all over the constitution every time they open their mouths.

They need to rely on these large brain-washing rallies to garner up support.  I don’t blame them though, what else is there to talk about?  Obama has thrived in office.

RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25/month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more… all while republicans bleated about Benghazi took pointless votes to repeal the ACA, and did nothing for anybody except the top one percent.  

It turns out that Obama is indeed “the adult in the room,” and yes, the Chess Master. Trump, on the other hand, is a man who represents everything that's wrong with this country.

In 2009, the last time the Federal minimum wage was increased, it became $7.25 an hour.

Which means that over 38 years (2009-1971=38), the minimum wage has increased a total of $5.65 (7.25-1.60=5.65). 

Divided over 38 years, the minimum wage has increased at 15¢ (per hour) per year (5.65/38= 15¢).

Do you think it's fair that huge highly profitable companies like, McDonalds, Walmart, Walgreens, ect. can pay a full time employee so little they are still eligible for government assistance? When you work 40 hours a week, regardless of what the nature of the work is you deserve dignity. Why should you have to work two jobs just to pay your bills? I will never understand why someone who makes a bit more than minimum wage would be opposed to the raising of it. Does it somehow make them feel better knowing someone is worse off? Like they go to bed at night and pray, ""Dear Jesus thank you for all the blessings in my life.

This is just for show. They want us to get complacent. Please phonebank for New Hampshire. Please go out and canvas. Please.

This is a trick. They are tricking us. If we don't put the effort we put in Iowa, the New Hampshire results will show Hillary losing with 45% to 54% against Bernie, and then they will say this:

""Hillary surprises with greater result than expected! And it was in the homebase of Bernieland! The polls said it would be 63% to 30%, and we all believed he was so strong there. Well, it seems that Iowa gave Clinton the needed push to outperform in New Hampshire! I guess at this point, there is nothing the Bernie campaign can do. Looks like it's over for them.""

2016-02-05T05:18:19+0000,"""For those who are still undecided, here are some highlights on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders 🇺🇸

Bernie wants to make healthcare available for everyone as a right, so neither you or your employer will have to pay health insurance directly, it’s just provided for everyone as a human right through a small tax that will replace your current health insurance payments. His plan will end up saving the US $6 billion in the next decade compared to what we currently spend on health care and will actually SAVE the average household about 5,000 every year and the average business about $10,000 a year. We are the ONLY major country in the world that doesn't provide health care for their people as a right.

He wants to make sure all women get at least 12-weeks of medical leave after having a baby so they can get to know their new child and learn to be a mom (this plan will only cost americans $1.61 a week) and he wants pay equality for women. He has a 50-year history of standing up for civil and minority rights and was even present at MLK's ""I have a dream"" speech.

He wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 gradually within 4 years, a plan which top economists agree will strengthen our economy because the more money people make, the more they spend on products and services. When companies sell more products and services, they make more money and hire more people to meet those demands. This plan improves the quality of life and income for individuals as well as businesses.

He wants to cap credit card interest rates at 15%, he wants to cap ATM fees at $2 because people shouldn’t have to pay up to $4.50 ($2 from the ATM and $2 or $2.50 for using a different bank than your own) to take out THEIR OWN money especially since ATM’s save the banks money.  He wants to equip the postal service with minor banking abilities so people in poor neighborhoods don’t have to go to paycheck advance places and get ripped off.

He wants to keep the police accountable when someone dies while in custody. He wants to end private prisons (the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world and has more people currently in prison than China - a COMMUNIST country with 4.3 times as many people as the US.

He wants to give students the ability to refinance their student loans at a lower percentage rate and he acknowledges that a college degree is the same as a high school diploma in today's world and he feels that nobody should be deprived of an education because of their income or inability to pay off loans so he wants to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, this will be paid for through a tax on wall street speculation (high-risk investments).  He feels it’s wrong that the taxpayers bailed them out and they still gave themselves millions in bonuses and changed little of their behavior so it’s their time to pay their fare share. He wants to break up ""too big to fail"" banks to prevent another financial collapse. He also wants to put those that caused the financial collapse in jail. He argues that a kid can go to jail for years and have their life and record ruined for smoking marijuana but the crooks on wall street that destroyed the lives of billions of people all over the world with their reckless behavior and greed just got a $700 billion bailout and a slap on the wrist.

He wants to end loopholes that save companies like wal-mart billions ($6 billion last year) while they push their employees to sign up for government assistance and he wants to end loopholes that allow companies to keep their money stashed in the cayman islands and other “tax havens”.

He wants to close loopholes that allow people to buy guns online and at gun shows without background checks. He tries to avoid war which saves us trillions, he wants to take big money out of politics so the US can be a democracy again.

He wants to expand social security so that when you retire, you have a decent income to keep you alive and happy, not just barely getting by.

He’s only 5 years older than Donald Trump, 6 years older than Hillary Clinton and 5 years YOUNGER than John McCain whose age became an issue 8 years ago when he ran against Obama and he’s still alive and well.

Today, 62 people own HALF of the world’s wealth...5 years ago that number was 388...  Bernie cares about people like you and I...and he’s funded by people like you and I...he’s literally received more individual contributions ($27 average) than ANY presidential candidate EVER at this point in the race....all the other people running for president are funded by the same people that are turning america into a place where only the ultra-rich and powerful have a say in what goes on.

In their collective sociopathy, their arrogance simply cannot grasp the concept that not everyone is on-board with their lunatic fervor. Hence, their claims of the, so-called, ""War on Christianity"".

2016-02-04T15:31:23+0000,"Bernie Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the non-defensive Iraq War. He rose to national prominence following his 2010 filibuster against the proposed extension of the Bush tax cuts for mega-wealthy individuals.

Even during historic senate/congressional grid-lock, Bernie is a leading progressive voice on issues such as income inequality, universal healthcare, parental leave, climate change, LGBT rights, and campaign finance reform. 

He is also outspoken on civil rights and civil liberties, and has been particularly critical of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system and mass surveillance policies and programs.

Comparing Socialism with Democratic Socialism is like comparing Foosball with Football.

A bird is not a plane,
And a plane is not a bird...

And Bernie Sanders is not a 'Marxist Socialist'...but a pro-market/pro-people Democratic Socialist who wants a more even playing field for all people including the middle class...via a stronger mixture of social (people) interests, rather than too heavily tilted corporate interests...like most economically strong Scandinavian countries. 

Fyi..Bernie Sanders is only 1 year older than Joe Biden...5 years older than Donald Trump...6 years older than Hillary Clinton. And Bernie is a decade younger than half of the Supreme Court Justices. And Bernie has been a public servant for 35 years...longer than some of the Founding Fathers.

So...the claim that ""He's too old or inexperienced to be president"" is a moot point. 

Bernie is Wise, Experienced, and he authentically cares about US✔️

Despite being trained as an artist, I am on the other end of the political spectrum - possibly because I have painfully deep knowledge of economics, law, and demonstrated human behavior.

But in this matter we are agreed:  In order to prevent the rise of european style social democracy (which I see as collapsing world round), we burned our middle and laboring classes.

This TPP, and anything whatever to do with The UN, and the treaty process in general, allows the state-corporate-media-academy alliance to deprive us of negotiating position, sovereignty (choice), and wealth, in favor of the expansion of large multi-national interests, and the politicians who remain in power because of their financial support.

The state-industry alliance has always existed and evidence is that it  must exist.  However, our only defense against the state as a corporation, and industry as corporations, is our legal soverignty, which both the state and industry are happy to take from us for their personal gain.

Affections.

2016-02-04T03:41:47+0000,"The only way I, as one person, know how to voice my displeasure at what the GOP has been doing since election night 2008, is to VOTE BLUE in every election until my dying breath.

I am a former Republican and a military veteran. My voting record, since I could first vote, went to Bush Sr (’88 & ’92), Dole (’96), Bush Jr (’00 & ’04) and Obama (’08 & ’12). Yet, over the past six years, my eyes have been opened to the obstructionist, RACIST, presidential disrespectfulness, big business-over-people-supporting, 1%-pandering, corporate welfare-giving, social security-cutting, climate change-denying, war mongering, foreign policy-sabotaging (think Iran #47Traitors letter), military veteran-patronizing, national infrastructure non-funding, xenophobia-inciting, Planned Parenthood-defunding, immigrant maligning, ARROGANCE, environmental catastrophe-inviting (think Keystone XL pipeline), union-busting, rich-getting-richer-while-poor-get-poorer-ensuring, refugee-bashing, presidential patriotism-questioning, NRA-ingratiating, income inequality-encouraging, human rights-preventing, ELITIST, war on women-perpetuating, HYPOCRITICAL, Jesus’ word-changing, sensible gun law-blocking, middle class-erasing, sacred land-selling, public land-drilling, PRIVATIZING, student loan lower interest rate-rejecting, Medicaid expansion-refusing, Equal Rights-dismissing, minimum wage hike-fighting, GREED-filled, equal pay-denying, path to citizenship-opposing, SCOTUS ruling-ignoring, gerrymandering, HATE-filled, vote suppressing, environmental deregulating, ""Citizens United"" supporting (think GOP-controlled SCOTUS), Koch-indebted, WHINING-because-you-didn’t-get-your-way, BIGOTRY, poor-and-less-fortunate-bashing, birther and fake scandal-creating (think also BENGHAZI, Hillary’s E-mails), presidential daughter-attacking, 60+time Obamacare-repealing (and failing), LYING, executive appointment-blocking, Peace Deal-threatening, jobs bill-ignoring, FAUX News-supporting, presidential suing at taxpayer expense, propagandizing, government closing and do-nothing positive GOP party that has been wreaking havoc since Obama took office.....and all this cloaked as the one true “religious,” “patriotic,” and ""conservative"" party and yet, contrary to the will of the American voter in two presidential elections.

While I don't agree with, nor support, all of Obama's policies, beliefs or actions, I give him credit for trying to do something to help everyday Americans struggling with day-to-day life issues which is more than I can say of the GOP party and leadership who made it their pledge upon Obama's first election to stop him from doing virtually anything during his presidency. Remember, it was Mitch McConnell (R-KY) who, instead of encouraging a bipartisan effort with the then-new president, is quoted as saying, ""The single most important thing we [the GOP] want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" Additionally, a Time magazine article outlined: “If he [Obama] was for it,” former [Republican] Ohio Senator George Voinovich explained, “we had to be against it.""

They failed in keeping Obama limited to one term but, even with this loss, the GOP has kept their second promise. They have done absolutely NOTHING to help the struggling American economy nor it's struggling people in well over six and a half years and we pay them millions in salary and benefits for their inadequacy and lack of work product! The rest of us would have been fired long ago if we produced absolutely zero for those who pay our salaries!  It is just remarkable what this president has accomplished, what with the obsessive obstacles purposefully thrown in his path.  Imagine what could have been accomplished if those elected, on the Right, actually worked with this president!

It’s past time to change the game plan and start benching the Republican party. Progress depends upon this. I am so done with these haters!

Don't just agree with me - Please VOTE every single time and encourage likeminded family and friends to do the same. NOTHING changes if we remain apathetic to voting!

------------
NOTE: Many on the Right, after seeing this essay have accused me of lying about my veteran status, or of ever having been a Republican in the first place. I welcome the challenge as to the first accusation. Please report me for ""stolen valor."" I am who I say I am. As for the second allegation, well, blind allegiances are just not my thing which is why, I believe, I was born with eyes, ears, and a brain.  For those who quickly dismiss this essay with “TL;DR” (too long, didn’t read), maybe you should take some time to read this as it affects YOU also.

Slaving away, day after day at a thankless job only to have the government swoop down and steal half in a nefarious socialist redistribution plot. All that money wasted, benefiting those ne'er-do-well steak and shrimp eating bastards on welfare. Being upset when life isn't fair is natural, healthy and oftentimes enjoyable. I mean who doesn't like externalizing blame for their shitty meaningless existence, this guy sure as hell does. I'm short I blame mom; I'm fat I blame Middleswarth chips; I like guys with their shirts off I blame Fight Club era Brad Pitt, everything else I blame Obama - hey, it works for FOX.
     Continually focusing blame on the poorest among us is exactly what the plutocrats want. How can republicans claim this is a Christian nation? We are outraged by the feeding of 46 million poor people but have no problem subsidizing the shit out of the Ultra-wealthy!
       I'm an incredibly lucky man fully cognizant that unworthy and blessed beyond measure sums up my life perfectly. Taxes piss me off only because the rules are far from fair - designed to keep the poorest, poor, the middle angry and the rich laughing. 
      Just think of all the senseless wars we could start if corporations, millionaires and billionaires paid the same percentage of their overall income as team Jerominski. Three months left in the year and $53,000 in taxes paid that's not including a similar amount from my better half. Dammit! I want to help feed the poor, educate the young, take care of our seniors and veterans. Not feed the egos and bank accounts of the Donald Trumps of this world.

One has been fighting the same fights for more than 30 years and the others position changes depending on who she's talking to. One is the preferred candidate of wall street and the DNC is doing everything they can to make sure she gets the nomination and will keep the status quo the way it is now. The other takes no money from wall street so he owes them nothing and will lead a revolution so the system works for all Americans not just the 1%. The DNC is doing everything they can to ensure this candidate doesn't get the nomination. One candidate marched with MLK and one candidate campaigned for a republican who wanted to overturn the civil rights act and restore segregation.

What are the results? 

*Today marijuana is America's #1 cash crop. 

*Today American kids can buy marijuana easier than they can buy a beer. 

*Marijuana is stronger and easier to get than ever before, albeit much more expensive than it should be.  To smoke casually from the “black market”, it will run you $100/month.  This is much more expensive than it needs to be.  More expensive than my cell phone ($20/month from Tmobile), car insurance ($25/month from Insurance Panda), netflix ($10/month), and gym ($15/month) COMBINED!!! Would you rather put money into the hands of violent gangs and drug dealers… or into taxes for schools, hospitals, public infrastructure, etc.???

*Today marijuana is the #1 source of income for violent drug gangs and drug cartels who are richer and more dangerous than ever before. 

*Guns are illegal in Mexico yet Mexican drug cartels are buying machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades, airplanes, armored vehicles, anti-aircraft guns, and even submarines. 

*There are over half a million Americans in jail right now for non-violent drug crimes. 

*The DEA has been having parties funded by drug cartels.
The ATF/DOJ has given thousands of guns to drug cartels.

Yeehaw pathetic tea party libertarians!  Tea party muppet Senator Joni Ernst and Michigan Governor Snyder should resign office.  
... 
While the kids in Flint, Michigan were being brain-damaged by poisoned water, Iowa Senator and Koch Koch Klan™ shill Joni Ernst helped pass a bill to destroy the Clean Water Act.  Thankfully President Obama vetoed it quickly.  
... 
We Angelenos really should check the lead in our water, too!  
... 
The problem comes from the tea party libertarian theory that government should be run efficiently, just like an ideal corporation... for profit only.  Who cares about a few kids in some backwater town like Flint with no money for the Super PAC?  
… 
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and his tea party muppets caused this.  Joni Ernst tried to make it worse.  They should all be in prison for poisoning the children of Flint.  
… 
There's a governmental disaster that is infrastructure in America... our trains are crashing and our bridges are rusting because libertarian money fools in our Pay-Per-Vote™ Congress and State and Local governments like Governor Rick Snyder keep their heads in the sand.  
... 
How many libertarian tea party fools does it take to change a light bulb?  
... 
None, the free market and god will take care of it.  
... 
Hey Koch Koch Klan™ shill, Joni Ernst!   Hey Governor Rick Snyder!  How many lies?  How many brain-damaged children?  How many deceptions before America sees the truth? 
... 
Your parks are in ruins and your bridges and railroads are rusting and your roads are rotting with decay.  
You ""don't need no"" infrastructure repairs in your state, do you?  
You ""don't need no"" taxes.  
You ""don't need no"" roads or bridges or parks or railroads anyway.  
You can buy “clean water” for your children from Nestles and Perrier.  
Your children ""don't need no"" parks either.

This may well be the most important election year in our lifetime.  For Bernie Sanders, this means the entire “Revolution” can be completed in a single day, if we simply vote.                                                                                                   It’s time.  Time to put money back in our pockets by eliminating health insurance premiums, co-pays and co-insurance.  It’s time to take many people off of public assistance, saving us money, through Bernie Sanders minimum wage plan.  It’s time to stop sacrificing our troops, our kids and our future.  Now is the time to better the country, our health and our planet for our children and grand children.  
This is the point in history where health care can become a right, and we can catch up with much of the world in this area.  This moment, when we can restore the middle class, and elevate those who strive to be part of it, is upon us.  
We MUST vote.  Vote by mail. Vote absentee, or utilize your state’s early voting procedure.  Vote in your primaries, and in the general election.  Vote on or by November 8th to determine what legacy we leave for those who follow us.  Vote U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, and for those who support him and OUR country.                                  ***                                   This is just the start of the list, and it continues to grow: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MZGzbSWESE8t18GGzrgc2FfL0b5tz-vmNf-F_-w5yN4/htmlview",1058395287586858_1058527254240328

The brownshirt tea party republican way is now to beat up protestors!  
... 
Now in business suits and ties and even scrub suits, the redneck brownshirts emerge from their sewers of hate, once more in our America. 
... 
Having grown up in the American South of Civil Rights times, the hatred of racism was in my face from my earliest memories. During the Nixon campaign the GOP was desperate and turned their once grand party into lapdogs for the white racist minority of the Southern States. That sickness thrives today. 
… 
Just like southern cops from the 1960's, fake patriot Ben Carson called all Muslims Anti-American, and Donald Trump's security team beat up Mexican protestors for the cameras and the Fox TV audience. When Rand Paul first ran for Kentucky Senate his thugs beat a gay protester down to the sidewalk and kicked him unconscious. 
... 
The Koch Koch Klan™ rules the new racist and anti-American republican party.

2016-02-02T23:14:38+0000,"HOW TO FIND ‘UNDECIDED’ VOTERS 
in NV, SC and “SUPER TUESDAY” STATES!!

(When you are NOT phone banking.)

The secret:  Post Bernie YouTube clips on NON-POLITICAL Facebook pages.  

Here’s what I mean.
1.	Log onto Facebook
2.	In the Search bar enter the name of a STATE (Super Tuesday states would be GOOD!!)
3.	ALSO in the Search bar enter the name of some wide-based GROUPS.  For instance
a.	Humane Societies and animal shelters
b.	Credit unions
c.	Local chapters of:  Planned Parenthood, League of Conservation Voters, NARAL
d.	College clubs and organizations
e.	Senior citizens services and centers
f.	Healthcare and medical groups
g.	Local labor groups
h.	Low income groups
i.	There are dozens of these types of groups…use your imagination
4.	Select a choice from the drop down menu
5.	Go to YouTube and find an appropriate Bernie video clip (there are HUNDREDS)
6.	Copy the video clip URL and paste it in the FB page you chose earlier.
7.	Add your own brief memo
8.	This whole deal takes 1-2 minutes each.

BOOM!  You just reached people OUTSIDE main stream politics AND delivered them an appropriate, powerful message from Bernie.

Since this process is designed to INTRODUCE Bernie to people still learning about him…..it is best to undertake this process WELL BEFORE a given state’s primary.  That’s why aiming at the SUPER TUESDAY STATES right now is the most helpful.

Repeat, repeat, repeat.  WE ARE BERNIE’S MEDIA.  This REALLY helps!",577844059036633_578433508977688

It has been replaced by warring tribes of rightwing zealots – evangelicals opposed to abortion, gay marriage, and science; libertarians opposed to any government constraint on private behavior; market fundamentalists convinced the “free market” can do no wrong; corporate and Wall Street titans seeking bailouts, corporate welfare, tax cuts, and deregulation; right-wing billionaires wanting more of the nation’s wealth than they own already; and white working-class Trumpoids who love Donald and hate Muslims, blacks, and Mexicans.
Each tribe has its own organization, its own sources of campaign funding, its own ideology, and its own candidates. What’s left is a lifeless shell called the Republican Party, but the Grand Old Party inside the shell is no more.
I, for one, regrets its passing. Our nation needs political parties to connect up different groups of Americans and to sift through prospective candidates. Without a Republican Party, nothing stands between us and a bunch of liars, bigots, egomaniacs, and creeps who decide on their own to seek the Republican nomination president.
